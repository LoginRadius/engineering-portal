                <h3>What Are We Looking For?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We welcome creative, 100% original, well-researched content
                    with actionable tips. So, when you are pitching your ideas
                    to us, make sure you mention how it fills our requirements.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Posts must not be written in an overly salesy or promotional
                    tone. We reserve the right to reject any post that does not
                    conform to our guidelines.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Write in your voice. We'd love your distinct opinion on the
                    topic.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your blogs should be at least 800 words long, most are in
                    the 800-1000 range.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Any claim you make must be backed by links to research. Use
                    primary sources only and they should not be 1-1.5 years old.
                    However, make sure they aren't our competitors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Try to explain with examples or case studies, and add
                    relevant images to illustrate your point, wherever possible.
                    We do not entertain stock photos, as they do not add any
                    value.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use proper formatting: titles, H1, H2, and H3 tags as
                    required.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    blogs.
