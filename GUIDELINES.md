## Some tips that you can keep in mind while writing the blog.

- Keep post's language simple and easy to understand, we are making our blogs for the mass and our audience doesn't need to be only native English speakers

- Use short paragraphs, break down longer paragraphs into smaller one, people lose their interest more while reading a long paragraph

- Use headers to structure your post, use large headers for the main heading and smaller for sub-sections in it

- Try to use complete words then abbreviations, spell out an acronym that isnâ€™t well-known

- If your code contains a code snippet, don't forget to syntax highlighting it, You can also specify the programming language for which you want syntax highlighting.
  **For example:** in markdown typing, ```js will give you JavaScript syntax highlighting.

- Try to use images/screenshots in your post to example things better, images are also visible when you share the post in social media

- Always provide a GitHub demo link whenever you post contains the code.

- Simplicity, Ease of Implementation of the content, developer-friendly and effectiveness
