## Virtual Brainstorming Tips/Tricks

Here are some of the effective tips for running brainstorming sessions for your [marketing strategies](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/Top-5-Marketing-Strategies-to-Power-up-Your-Business/).

### 1. Gather team from various disciplines

Virtual brainstorming is a great way to get a wide range of teams on the same platform. Therefore, you must invite people from various disciplines in the organization, as well, and get their ideas and perspectives. It will help you acquire a broader set of suggestions and increase the creativity of your team.

### 2. Start with icebreakers

Want to host a Virtual Brainstorm session that will bring out the creativity of your teammates? Start with icebreakers to encourage people to verbalize their ideas often. The key to increasing participation and energy is by organizing a brainstorming session that won't stifle spontaneity. So, start with motivating words and get your teammates on their feet from the beginning.

### 3. Set expectations

Setting out ground rules lets people be clear on the purpose of the meeting. Plus, prepping ahead readies a team more open to participating. To make your collaborative brainstorming online successful, brief your team about what they need to prepare and what to expect from the session. Doing this will increase confidence and engagement when you host an online brainstorming  session.

### 4. Keep a moderator

Moderators can help focus on the goals, clarify ideas, motivate introverts, and keep a session engaging. A perfect idea may not come at the beginning of a session, but keeping an eye out for people with unique ideas can help you get a thoughtful suggestion in the first session. You can choose a moderator who can share a brief idea about the session ahead of the scheduled meeting time. Doing this will help your team stick to the goal during the brainstorm session.

### 5. Let everyone speak

If only a few people talk in your meeting, you won't get as many business ideas as you need. Some of the introverts of your team may not come forward at all. Therefore, it is crucial to approach the session more supportively and positively. Press the Mute button whenever needed. Giving everyone a chance to speak by encouraging others to set themselves to mute will let others speak up, and everyone will listen and hear each other.

  

### 6. Experiment with different techniques and tools

Each brainstorming session doesn't have to be the same. If you are thinking about how to boost creativity? You can use different mind mapping  tools and an online brainstorming board to create a plan of opportunities, information, and issues.

### 7. Appreciate the team

Want to motivate your team to participate in brainstorm sessions in the future? Remember, it is vital to acknowledge their efforts, appreciate, and thank them.
