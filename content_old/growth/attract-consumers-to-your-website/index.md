Is your Google search history filled with queries like, "How to attract buying consumers for my website?" 

You may have a great product and an even better website. However, neither of these two is going to attract consumers to your website. If your product is not digital, most of your consumer base may not even know about the existence of your site. 

Therefore, you need to figure out ways to attract them, pull them in, and keep them coming back for more. A sound marketing strategy is required for your [business to achieve this feat](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/01/consumer-experience-b2b-saas/).

These five easy-to-implement, inexpensive tricks will help you develop a marketing strategy to attract online consumers to your website.


### 1. Define the ideal route for conversion.

To begin with, it's essential to recognize how you want the consumers to connect with your website prior to creating any plans or strategies for the website. This could be how much guest blogging you should engage in or the kind of content you provide. 

Regardless, the aim of your site is to provide value to your visitors. Most brands use content strategies as part of their inbound marketing efforts to give value and to bring in new visitors to the site. 

However, the key point here is that every consumer undergoes a conversion process, where they turn into a loyal consumer from a curious visitor. This journey differs from one company to another. Therefore, your first step towards attracting visitors should be to lay down the [ideal conversion route](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/01/sign-up-tips-conversion-rate/) for your target audience.

The route will go something like this:



*   A person has an issue.
*   They check online for solutions.
*   Your website pops up in the search results.
*   They click the link of the blog you wrote on that topic to read it. 
*   Reading further, they press on the CTA option visible at the bottom of your blog post, drawing them to the proposal for premium content. The reader is converted into a consumer. 
*   They are now turned into a contact in your process and are now admitted into the sales program (according to their level of activities on the website).

 


### 2. Build personas of your buyers.

Buyer Persons works as a representation of a potential consumer. These will function as your stepping stone while piecing together your marketing strategies.

If you want individuals to visit your website and ultimately turn into consumers, the initial step you should take is recognizing who your target audience is and what their patterns and desires are. The personas you have will direct your content production and ensure that you deliver accurate and specific content that your target audience is seeking.

While recognizing the ideal personas, you should be asking yourself some of the questions, 



*   What do they do for a living?
*   How do they describe their professional achievements?
*   What social media platforms do they prefer?
*   What messages do they relate to?
*   How do they communicate (emails, phone calls, texts, etc.)?
*   What challenges do they face daily?

By identifying the answers to these questions, while choosing ideal personas, you will be able to build content that would be perfect and suitable as per the consumers' requirements which will eventually help in converting them into buying consumers.


### 3. Never ignore social facts.

The promotion of your content through social media platforms is among the popular ideas to attract consumers to your website. A place where sharing is promoted is social media. Your content can have a wider reach through social media promotion.

However, being new and getting started on social media platforms can be a tedious job. Consider these factors when establishing your social media marketing strategies to attract potential consumers to your website:



*   The platform where the consumers spend the majority of their time
*   Social media platforms they use the most.
*   Platforms where they usually share or engage content with their connections
*   The platform with the majority of potential consumers for your industry.

By considering these factors, you can get a hold of the social media channels having the majority of suitable consumers for your industry type. If you've identified that none of your prospects or thought leaders are present on Twitter, you do not want to waste your time there, as it will not lead to an increase in engagement or your return rates.

Once you've identified and started concentrating on platforms, build a publishing plan for social media that allows you to keep to a schedule. You will find several resources that will help you plan social media posts in advance, giving you time to interact with your audience and checking out the competitors every day. Being disciplined about this will allow you to get more visitors to your site. 

Many businesses today rely a lot on sharing and advertising their material on social media, with around [83% of marketers](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b2b-2021-research-final.pdf) using and viewing them as a lucrative marketing channel. They use social media to connect and share their content and that of others, and so should you. Through social media accounts, you can share your blog posts with your audience; doing so can increase traffic to your website. 

Since not many brands reply to follower comments, if you do it, your audience is more likely to go through the funnel quickly, i.e., they convert into consumers of your products or services._ _


### 4. Keep a new and appropriate experience.

By ensuring the presence of an advanced and appropriate user experience, a business owner can have their website generating viable and convertible leads. Businesses can achieve this through valuable content on both their blogs and their website.   

Businesses can improve user experience by:



*   Giving out discounts and offers.
*   Ensuring the website is well designed and looks attractive.
*   Ensuring the Search Engine Optimization rankings of the website are good.
*   Having simple and easy to understand messages on the website.
*   Making sure every page has a specified and explicit call to action.
*   Asking for consumer feedback.
*   Having content that is consumer-focused. 

Instead of engaging them, a misleading website scares away organic traffic from your site. The quick, intuitive navigation that is simple to use should be a feature on your website. 

Furthermore, your website should load quickly and be mobile and tablet-friendly. When your site has all these features along with quality content, its search rankings go up, which then increases your website's traffic. 


### 5. Make it easier for consumers to meet you.

Do not provide consumers with a long line of options until you can put someone on the line. Provide them with an easy chatbox, email, or call support for contacting you. 

You can even provide your social media accounts information on your website so that the consumers can reach out to you through social media. However, when heading down this path, make sure you reply on time or as early as you can. Research shows that [42% of consumers](https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/) expect a reply to their complaints on social media in under 60 minutes. 

Making yourself more available to your consumer will not only help you create a positive consumer experience but also increase traffic to your site. 


## Conclusion

The right way to attract consumers to your website need not be rocket science. All you need is a good strategy and consistency to make things work for you. Constant content upgrades can always help you drive traffic to your website; simply make sure they are SEO optimized. 

Don't forget to build growth strategies after creating content to draw users to your platform so that the leads have appropriate content in their inbox after they have been converted. You should give them the option to subscribe periodically, whether it is monthly or weekly, to receive your content. Another critical part of bringing more traffic to your site is ensuring the website updates the current content.

By following these five tricks, you can make the most of your strategies to attract online consumers while also maintaining them and ensuring that they get converted into leads.
