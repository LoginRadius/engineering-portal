### **What Is A Payment Gateway?**

A payment gateway is a processing unit that approves online payments (debit cards, credit cards, e-wallets, netbanking) for online purchases. The gateways protect highly sensitive details like account holder details, card details, and so on. The data is transferred securely between the two groups: merchant site and customer.

### **Different Kinds Of Payment Gateways**

There are two types of payment gateways. They are as follows:-

- ****Shared Gateway**** In this type of gateway, the payment is processed while keeping customer on the merchant site page. As soon as the detail is filled by the customer, a transaction is processed. Shared gateway is the most preferable gateway as it provides the convenience of staying in the merchant site. Some of the examples are _Authorize.net CIM and Stripe._

- ****Hosted Gateway**** Hosted Gateway is the payment process where the customer is directed to the payment gateway website. Afterwards, when the transaction is completed, he or she is redirected to the merchant site.Example:- _Setcom, Paypal Standard, Payza_
