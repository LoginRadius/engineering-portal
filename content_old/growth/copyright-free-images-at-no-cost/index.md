#### **CC Search**

It is a Search engine powered by Creative Commons. You can find every photos which are under Creative Commons banner (license) via [CC Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/). I understand the fact that CC search is not a search engine (technically) but it do show results from various websites like Flickr, Google Images, Pixabay, Fotopedia and Europeans. The search is fast as CC search does not search every website simultaneously. You tell them what to search and where to search by selecting websites.

You can also search videos, music and other media formats through it.
