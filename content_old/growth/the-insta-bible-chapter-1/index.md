However, there are still many [reasons](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/) for you to chose Instagram. And here is an A to Z guide about Instagram that will help you create more user base for your business.

But before we move ahead, let me again clear the point _why are we talking about Instagram._

As the use of photo sharing applications are trending today, different businesses are using Instagram. Moreover, as Instagram provides you the platform to share photos and short videos, it has acquired big brands like [Nike](https://www.instagram.com/nike/) as users.

Now, let’s begin with the basics of Instagram below:-

### **How to set up an Instagram Account**

Instagram is an extremely powerful channel for business promotion. Hence, to exploit its features, firstly, you have to create an Instagram account.

- Download the app from Playstore or App store.
- Open the App and either login with your Facebook account or Signup with your email address
- Now, create a username and add a photo to your account.
- Afterwards, put in your phone number (mandatory, in case of reclaiming account) and full name.
- Then, start using your account for connecting with people

### **How to Choose The Right Account for You**

Again, it is very important to decide which type of account is beneficial to you. Firstly, your account should provide a clear glimpse of what you are all about and that’s why it is vital to get it right from the very beginning.

There are three types of accounts: a personal account, a business account, and a fan-page account.

#### **1\. Personal Account**

Here are some examples of personal accounts. Get inspired by them!

#### **2\. Business account**

As the name implies, the business account endorses its products and if you want to get more of them, you will have to click the link given in their bio.

#### **3\. F****an-Page Account**

Fan-page are an instant hit on Instagram as these accounts are not intended to sell a product. People easily accept them but they are made for different purpose. Hence, when can you create them? Like if you own a card shop, you can also create a fan page having nice quotes about life and build a business behind the scenes.

And for every type of account you choose, you need to decide an effective and consistent theme (environment) throughout the account. To make it easy for you to decide upon the account, have a look at your competitors about what they are doing and also catch the taste of your audience.

It is critical to decide on the type of Instagram account on your page as choosing a wrong account can cause confusion in the market and damage your brand. So, be very clear about which account to choose.

### **Profile Picture: A very important business**

For the cause of Instagram being so visual and from a branding perspective, a logo or profile picture is a deciding factor for your brand. Hence, any person who visits your account on Instagram makes an opinion about your organization through your profile picture. Hence, a wrong profile picture can create confusion among your visitors and it is recommended to add a personal image or your business logo (self made or created by a professional) to your account depending upon the type of Instagram account.

For consistent personal branding, it is recommended to use the same logo for all social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and many more).

To edit or add a profile picture, select “Edit Profile” > Select the option of your preference > Save it.

### **How to choose the best Username available**

Piggybacking a recognized brand in your niche: for example, if you are displaying news related to entrepreneurship, use entrepreneur in your username. When people search the brand “entrepreneur”, your brand will be shown next to the _Big brand_.

Thus, it will provide a great momentum to your branding.

### **H****ow to write a phenomenal bio**

Crafting a compelling bio needs focus to the thought that whom you are serving to. Identify your audience and cater according to their taste. It will directly help in boosting your sales, leads, and traffic. Moreover, you only have 150 characters as bio length and you can place your clickable link nowhere else other than your bio. This gives bio a more important role in Instagram when compared to bios in other social media sites.

So, choose your words wisely as your bio is the only place which can help your visitors to decide whether to click your link or not. That’s where the results will be coming from.

- Write a brief and interesting introduction about your service or product
- Include benefits in your bio
- Include some more information about company like location and place a call to action followed by your link
- You can also display information in the form of bullet points. It will make your information look short and to the point.
- Shorten your link in the bio using tools like bitly or goo.gle and make sure that the link is a customized link and does not look like a spammy one. You can also include emoticons if you want.
- Also, use notepad to write your bio and paste it into instagram instead of directly typing it into instagram to avoid spacing problems.
- So, make your bio, test it, and if you like it, paste it.

### **How to create a Landing Page**

As told earlier, Instagram is one of the best platforms to acquire thousands of opt-ins every week. There are already many organizations using the social networking site to the fullest. Here are some points which can improve your landing page building skills:-

#### **1\. Give away the FREE gift**

It is called the “lead magnet” and it will certainly increase your customer email database. Now, the choice of the product to be given away will be dependent on your wisdom to judge your audience. After studying your audience’s desire, problems or frustrations, provide a product for FREE. This is very important.

_Note:- Always give something that looks worthful and that solves a serious problem. Test your product before rendering it to the audience. Moreover, keep that analysis handy (the statistics can be used for your product’s promotion)._

Now, remember the link that you provided in your bio! When your customer clicks the link, he will reach your landing page. Then, he will be greeted by the FREE gift.

You can receive the code through SMS on your registered phone number or backup codes (one-time users).

#### **How to turn on Two Step Authentication**

- To turn on two step verification, select the profile option in the menu bar (at the bottom side of screen).
