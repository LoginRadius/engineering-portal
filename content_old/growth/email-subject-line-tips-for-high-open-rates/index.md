So, here presenting before you some different kinds of subject lines and some must follow steps which can take your email marketing strategies to a whole new level.

### **Curiosity**

When talking about human traits, curiosity quickly comes to my mind. Humans are really curious creatures and you can use this trait to create awesome subject lines which will tempt your email recipients to open your emails.

**_You can add elements of curiosity like:-_**

- Introducing interesting surprises in the mail (Eg:- Don’t forget, **Surprise Gift Waiting for you**)
- Mentioning something unusual or strange (Eg:- Don’t Eat before You read This), or
- Asking them interesting questions (Eg:- How to make $100 per day? Answer Inside!!).

### **Humour**

Using humour for email marketing demands creativity and thought but it can prove fruitful in respect to open rates. If you are capable of making your audience laugh, your efforts can pay off. Some funny examples from some nice brands to get inspired and tickle your funny bone:-

- **Baby Bump:** “Yes, I’m Pregnant. You Can Stop Staring At My Belly Now.”

### **Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)**

You cannot resist the feeling of “missing out” an opportunity. Fear Of Missing Out is an psychological human attribute which you can use in your email marketing drive. How? Just add a bit of urgency or scarcity to your subject line. As discussed above, the element boosts open rates. Some great examples from the brand name **digital marketer** for you to refer:-

- **Digital Marketer:** “\[WEEKEND ONLY\] Get this NOW before it’s gone…”
- **Digital Marketer:** “Your 7-figure plan goes bye-bye at midnight…”

- **Rip Curl:** “Two for two”
- **HP:** “Flash. Sale. Alert.”
