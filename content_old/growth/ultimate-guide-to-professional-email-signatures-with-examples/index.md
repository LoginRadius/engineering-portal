This data is enough to prove the unawareness lying around signature and that’s where we need this article.

### **How to create the best email signatures?**

#### **1\. Keep it short!**

While there are many who don’t have any email signature at all, there are some others as well who treat their email signature like the mini autobiographies, jamming all possible links, quotes, and tons of information. But what they don’t realize is that by adding excessive information, the signature loses its original charm and will seem bulky for readers to even look at it let alone clicking on the same.

In general, the basic information needed in email signature is as below :![Basic Email Signature]( Basic-Email-Signature.png?ver=1553881376)Therefore experts recommend to use only the information that best indicates your professional brand, generally the email signature of four lines is standard format. Once you are done with the basic format, the next step is to personalize it.

PS.. To condense email signature in fewer lines, make use of pipeline (|) or colons (::) to separate links.

#### **2\. Avoid including your email address :**

Adding email address to your email signature is nothing but the wastage of space, the reasons are:

- The reader can easily get email address by hovering the mouse over sender’s name even if it is not already visible.
- One can always hit the reply button.

You must save this place for something more valuable like your social icons, CTA, your business blog, etc.

#### **3\. Strict “NO” to multiple phone numbers :**

Ever seen an overstuffed email signature? Here is what it looks like :

![over stuffed email signature]( over-stuffed-email-signature.png?ver=1553881376)

Imagine how difficult and irritating it will be for the reader especially if he or she uses a mobile device.

So choose your contact preferences wisely!  Listing every contact number, every social profile link and every mail id is an overkill. And the popular phenomenon of “[Paradox of choice](http://psychologyformarketers.com/paradox-of-choice/)” says that the more pages you will link to, the less likely it is for the recipient to click on any of them. So add only the most preferred points of contact.

PS. if you are working with people from around the world, always make sure to add your country code while listing down your phone number.

#### **4\. Add social profiles :**

Your social media presence is a crucial part of your personal branding. The way you portray yourself on social media networks, the kind of posts you like and share, can tell people a lot about you which is why making social media profiles a part of your email signature will not only reinforce your personal brand but also provide the reader multiple ways to contact you. Additionally, it can also help you drive more traffic if you share your content on social media profiles.

But again, nobody is implying you to add links of all of your social media profiles. Include only those social profiles where you are active. And instead of including social media links, prefer using social icons as they will be more easily recognizable amongst all the text. [_Did you know_](http://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/) _the human mind takes just 150ms to process a symbol and 100 ms to process its meaning, quite fast, isn’t it?_

Check out this email signature example of our head marketing analyst, Prince Kapoor who is active on multiple profiles, so it makes sense that he has made social icons a part of his email signature as the points of contact.

#### **5\. Add Image :**

It is a widely known fact that people remember visuals more than the plain text. But with that, I don’t mean you can put any kind of image in your email signature. There is always a certain kind of image that can make a difference to your email signature. You are more likely to remember a signature like this, won’t you?

![Professional Email Signature With Real Image]( Professional-Email-Signature-with-real-image.png?ver=1553881376)

Reason being as per research says, most memorable photos are those that contain people, also color images are often more memorable than the black and white ones. Here are some tips you need to follow :

- Use a professional image, not a selfie or the one cropped from other picture
- The size of image shouldn’t be too big as it will take more time to load
- Make sure you are dressed and groomed professionally
- Prefer using a headshot rather than the complete body picture.

#### **6\. Add Call to action :**

One of the smartest way of leveraging the power of email signature is by adding a call-to-action in the same. The best CTA for an email signature should be simple, up-to-date, not too pushy and aligned with the theme of email and above all, doesn’t look like a sales pitch.You must put a CTA that is in sync with your business goal and must keep updating it regularly. The CTA can be anything from “click here for a free demo” to “download an ebook”.

#### **7\. Make sure the links are trackable :**

So you have created a great email signature that highlights all your important links and contains CTA too but ever wondered if anyone has really clicked on them? If you want to figure out if people are really clicking on them or not, make your links trackable. Adding UTM parameters to the links is a great way to do that. Check out this [step by step guide to use UTM parameter](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-use-utm-parameters/) by Neil Patel. Also test out multiple CTA formats to find out which ones are driving maximum clicks.

#### **8\. Optimize for mobile :**

As per the recent [research](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/3/), 68% of emails are getting opened on mobile devices and this figure keeps on rising every year. The stats clearly indicate the need to keep mobile users in top of mind while writing emails which includes email signature too.

The best way to make your email signature mobile optimized is to choose the design that is easy to read and easy to click for mobile audience. Use font size, keeping mobile screens in mind and make sure the links have enough space in between.

#### **9\. Go modern!**

Most of the brands these days are opting for the modern email signature approach. An email signature which is clean font, sleek and fresh never goes off air. Here are some things you need to look for if you are one of those creative professionals and want your email signature to indicate the same :

- Crisp font
- Uncluttered design
- Large text with flat design (3-D looks are strict no)
- Use small splash of the bold color.

#### **10\. Test your email signature with more than one email clients to make sure it works fine :**

Finally, now that you have created the best email signature that goes with your personality, don’t forget to test it across various email clients. For eg, when you talk about Microsoft outlook, it doesn’t recognize the background images so don’t use them. Testing across various email clients will provide you surety that your email signature looks as good as you thought.

PS, below are some additional tips, if kept in mind, will help you to craft a perfect email signature :

- If you are using a quote, make sure it doesn’t seem offensive to anyone.
- There is no need to add a legal disclaimer unless it is must.
- Don’t add that virus-checked message below every email.
