Everyone desires and deserves to look good in his or her professional space. Whether it’s on LinkedIn or attending a business event, you ensure to look good in front of others. And why not? You are constantly being judged on the basis of how you present yourselves to the world. Hence, you take grooming seriously. But, many of you constantly overlook an area that deserves much more attention. It’s how you look on paper. Precisely speaking, it is your professional bio. And if you think that how many people go through such things (**if you have one**)? I’ll say that there are lots of people scanning it. And even if you are not taking it seriously, they are (I assure you that). 

Professional bios are much more visible than your resumes. You can use it on LinkedIn, Twitter, on your blog or website, as an author bio and any place where you need to present yourself. In a nutshell, professional bio is your juju to empower your professional network.

Well, you can find out how to create a five-star professional bio by clicking [here](https://www.loginradius.com/fuel/how-to-write-professional-bio-with-examples/).

### **4\. Laura Zigman**

**[Source](http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2009/01/23/laura-zigman/personalities/in-the-green-room/)**

Laura has a good sense of humour and that reflects in her professional bio. She takes the help of third person narrative to describe her journey as a blogger and a novelist. Here is how she does it:-

“[_Laura Zigman_](https://laurazigman.wordpress.com/life-story/) _grew up in Newton, Massachusetts (where she felt she never quite fit in), and graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (where she didn’t fit in either) and the Radcliffe Publishing Procedures Course (where she finally started to feel like she fit in)._

_She spent ten years working (slaving away) in New York in book publishing where she was a (much-abused under-appreciated) publicist for Times Books, Vintage Books, Turtle Bay Books, Atlantic Monthly Press, and Alfred A. Knopf._

_After moving to Washington, D.C. (because she was burnt out and didn’t know where else to go) and working briefly as a project manager for The Smithsonian Associates (she had a cubicle) and a consultant for Share Our Strength, an anti-poverty non-profit group (she didn’t even have a cubicle), she (finally) finished her first novel (that she’d been writing in her “spare time” for the last five years)._

_(The thinly-disguised autobiographical novel) Animal Husbandry was published in 1998 by The Dial Press and became a national bestseller. It was published in fourteen countries (or more, she’s not sure — see here) and in 2001 the film based on the book, Someone Like You, (they changed the title at the last minute because they were afraid people wouldn’t “get” the meaning of the original title — not that she’s complaining or anything) starring Ashley Judd and (excuse her while she drools) Hugh Jackman, was released by Fox 2000. Her second (thinly-disguised autobiographical) novel, Dating Big Bird, also published by The Dial Press, came out in 2000, and her third (thinly disguised autobiographical) novel, Her, published by Knopf (where she once worked — an exquisite irony), followed in 2002. Her latest (thinly-disguised autobiographical) novel, Piece of Work, to be published by Warner Books on September 25, 2006 (finally, after four long years in between books — maybe her parents will now leave her alone), is based on her (horrific but entertaining) experiences as a publicist and has been optioned by Tom Hanks’ production company, Playtone Pictures, with My Big Fat Greek Wedding’s Nia Vardalos (luff her) set to write the screenplay and star in the movie (please God let that happen)._

_She currently lives outside Boston (in the same town she grew up in — how weird is that? — and where she now feels like fits in) with her husband and young son.”_

Hence, these are some great bios I would like to share with you. Hope it will helps to carve your first-rate professional bio in mind and paper. If you want to learn how to create them, refer to the link provided in the introduction.

**A last piece of advice**: First person narrative or third person narrative, it doesn’t matter as long as your content is interesting. Consider your professional bio as as any other write up and make sure that it’s interesting. Also, do not brag too much about yourselves and annoy your audience. Rest of the things will follow.

Thank you for reading!
