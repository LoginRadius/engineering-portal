Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹ !!! Today we are announcing the beta release of [LoginRadius CLI](https://github.com/LoginRadius/lr-cli#readme). I am very much excited about it.

## Why LoginRadius CLI?

Developer Experience plays a crucial role for us. We always think about the ways we can minimize the juggling between a quickstart tutorial, dashboard, and terminal. 
The LoginRadius CLI will simplify your flow by just using some simple commands to **register, login, add site, add social, etc.**, and enables you to get the job done in very little time without leaving the terminal.
