When you work for a tech company in an office capacity, it feels like everyone around you is speaking another language. Which they are, most of their work exists in coding language. To feel more relevant, I signed up on [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/) and started working on their beginner courses (for free! you should try it!).

Here are some things I have learned about coding:

1. There are many different ways to code. Not every website or app is made using the same terms or patterns, programmers and developers have options for how they want to format their content, and how they want to communicate with their computer.
2. Coding is more about seeing what you want in your head than about math. Deciding exactly what you want and communicating it is the big struggle. Having your website/app be capable of computing things is optional, but the layout is mandatory. (Not to mention the most noticeable aspect of your site).
3. Code is like a language. The words and punctuation must be learned for each coding language. Though they can be linked to English words (like “p” for a new paragraph), you have to be able to pull them up quick in your mind. As with any language, repetition is key to recognition.
4. You don’t have to start from scratch (but you can). There are frameworks available, like Bootstrap, which have some existing templates you can draw from. This helps you when you are constructing your site, so that you can set up your layout quicker, and have more time to work on your content.
5. There are some areas of knowledge that you don’t need to memorize, but having an understanding of what they do will be helpful in coding:
    1. The hexi-decimal system (and how it relates to color)
    2. Binary code
    3. ASCII
6. Once you learn some of the basics, websites you see every day will start to seem simpler. You will be able to pick out some of their elements, and if you look at their bare code, you will recognize how they come together.
7. The world of coders is large and easy to access. If you have questions, there is someone online who is willing and eager to answer. This is not a skill that anyone was born with, and due to new languages etc, everyone is still learning. 

I hope that this list has contributed to your knowledge, and would encourage you to check online for available resources to expand (or begin) your abilities in coding.
