# Login with Google Apps


## Overview

Login with Google Apps is a trusted enterprise plugin that many businesses use for Single Sign On (SSO). 

Google Apps supports SAML protocol to provide secure authentication. It maps the attribute, for example, username, first name, last name, and email, to consumer details. 

Therefore, with Google Apps Login's assistance, you can manage consumer attributes from G Suite Profile data to your website and update consumer details at the time of registration or login. 

You can also control user access through role mapping, which helps you assign specific roles to the consumer in the user's group in Google Apps / G Suite.


## Why Should Businesses Use Google Apps

Do you have a successful solo business? Or do you have a team of 200 people working for you? You may want to set up the G Suite to improve your efficiency.

G Suite is the new name for Google Apps, which was formerly known as Google Apps. Perhaps more so, Google revealed that the Google for Work brand has been revamped and is now known as Google Cloud.

The transition is part of a trend that Google believes will enable them to reach a larger audience by focusing less on the work element and collecting valuable apps for everyday life.

Google apps have become the industry standard for in-house workflow, making the lives of working individuals easier and less stressful.


## The Benefits of Using G Suite

There are many advantages of using the G Suite paid subscription that goes beyond email accounts ownership.

 


### **File Control**

The primary concern of the previous generation was keeping track of essential files that were being collaborated on within its bounds. 

Now, granting permission to documents stored on the cloud is worry-free by presenting the administrator's creation and ownership. 

You can also sync an employee's device to upload all files from their laptop, which can be accessed after they leave.


### **Share Drive**

By combining an entire team below one roof, you can effortlessly share documents across the same storage space with a single click of a button. 

The sharing setting also permits different restrictions if you want to. For example, you can set 'can edit' and view-only authorizations according to the individual access requirements.


### **Email Grouping**

Your business may have various departments and roles based on the operations. Remembering every individual's email upon sending out a message to a specific department is difficult, so you can align people who should be receiving the message into categories, for example, Accounting, Marketing, Products, Human Resource, etc.

 


### **Infinite Aliases**

You can use multiple aliases for every single G Suite account. For example, I work for a software company that is divided into several departments. I receive emails under three aliases:

contactus@loginradius.com

Info@loginradius.com

accounts@loginradius.com

This feature allows you to create precise and suggestive starting points for potential clients to get in contact with. The different nicknames can also be applied to various accounts as a way for your partners to handle incoming emails as a team.


### **Ample Storage Capacity**

Usually, a G-Suite account provides the limit of 30GB at a $5/month level. This can be immediately upgraded to individual accounts by paying.

 


### **24/7 Support**

You're entirely covered 24/7 with the phone, email, and live chat[ customer support](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213).


### **Multi-factor Authentication**

G Suite offers [2-step verification](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/01/how-to-setup-2fa-in-online-accounts/) that can enforce on all of your organization's users to ensure all the devices connecting to your network have been verified through phone and email.


## Integrating Google Apps

    

To integrate Google clients, you can allow your application's users to log in to an OAuth-enabled application without creating an account with the help of a platform. 

Let's assume you have an application that has an Identity Platform enabled and another application that is Google. You require that the existing customers of your application should be able to access the Google application without creating a separate account. 

It gets automatically logged into G suite if already logged into your application (in the same browser) and vice-versa. Considering the above example, the following are some quick points about the application[ OAuth 2.0](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/oauth2/) flow:

Then **Identity Platform** acts as an Identity Provider, meaning it can authorize the login request received from google. Your G Suite acts as a **Service Provider.**


## Conclusion

The Google Apps suite is an excellent alternative to the more traditional productivity suites. G suite not only changes the dynamic for interaction between different teams, but it can also change the medium of teams interact with each other. Cloud Computing has many benefits, but we shouldn't lose sight that there is no foolproof solution.

Apart from the [privacy issues](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-security/), there is always a risk associated with multiple means of communication and the number of platforms used in an organization. These applications can simplify your life or make it more complicated depending on whether or not you choose the right apps for the job.
