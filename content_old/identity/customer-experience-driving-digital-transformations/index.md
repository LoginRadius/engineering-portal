Today’s customers are not tied down to a single channel. They browse in-store, shop online, share feedback through mobile apps and ask questions to your support team on social media.

To truly create a seamless [multi-channel experience](https://www.loginradius.com/connected-customer-experience/) for your users, your customers need to be able to access any of your digital properties without having to re-authenticating every time.
