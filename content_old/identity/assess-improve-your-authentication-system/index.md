The digitally advanced business landscape has offered enormous opportunities to enterprises striving for business success in the most competitive environments. 

Businesses leverage cutting-edge technologies to accelerate their growth by offering seamless experiences to their consumers whenever and wherever they want. 

However, security is still one of the most common bottlenecks of every industry, which can’t be overlooked, especially when the number of [data breaches is soaring](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/how-to-handle-data-breaches/) day by day. 

Whether we talk about data leaks or identity thefts, businesses that become victims of security breaches are compromising their brand reputation and losing millions of dollars every year. 

Hence, robust authentication and authorization mechanism becomes a necessity and not just a luxury. 

So does it means that businesses that are using an [authentication system](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/) on their website or mobile application are protected against every security breach? 

Unfortunately, this isn’t the case!

With cybercriminals finding new ways to sneak into a business network, enterprises should consider relying on an authentication mechanism that offers stringent security layers and not just those that validate a user based on specific criteria. 

Let’s dig deeper into this and understand how enterprises can evaluate the quality of a user authentication system before making a decision. 


## Authentication and Authorization

Before we inch towards understanding the aspects of a robust [authentication and authorization](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/authentication-vs-authorization-infographic/) mechanism, let’s quickly understand the difference between authentication and authorization. 


### What is Authentication

Authentication is the process of identifying users and validating who they claim to be. One of the most common and apparent factors to authenticate identity is a password. If the user name matches the password credential, the essence is valid, and the system grants access to the user.

Interestingly, with enterprises going passwordless, many use modern authentication techniques like one-time passcodes (OTP) via SMS, or email, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometrics, etc. authenticate users and deploy security beyond what passwords usually provide.


### What is Authorization

Authorization happens after a user’s identity has been successfully authenticated. It is about offering full or partial access rights to resources like databases, funds, and other critical information to get the job done.

For example, in an organization, after an employee is verified and confirmed via ID and password authentication, the next step would be defining what resources the employee would have access to.


## Difference between Authentication and Authorization

Let’s understand the core of utilizing authentication and authorization and how one differentiates from the other.

For instance, an organization will allow all its employees to access their workplace systems (that’s authentication). But then, not everyone will have the right to access its gated data and resources (that’s authorization).

Implementing authentication with the proper authorization techniques [through a CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/) (consumer identity and access management) solution can protect organizations, while streamlined access will enable its workforce to be more productive.

A CIAM solution uses authentication and authorization technologies like JWT, SAML, OpenID Authorization, and OAuth.


### Different Ways of User Authentication



* **Password-based Authentication:** It is a simple method of authentication that requires a password to verify the user's identity. 
* **Passwordless Authentication:** In this method, a user is verified through [OTP or a magic link](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/loginradius-launches-passwordless-login-with-magic-link-or-otp/) delivered to the registered email or phone number.
* **2FA/MFA** **(Multi-factor Authentication):** It requires more than one security level, like an additional PIN or security question, to identify a user and grant access to a system. 
* **Single sign-on (SSO):** It allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. 
* **Social Authentication:** It verifies and authenticates users with existing credentials from social networking platforms.


### Different Ways of User Authorization 



* **Role-based Access Controls (RBAC):** It can be implemented for system-to-system and user-to-system privilege management.
* **JSON web token (JWT):** It is an open standard for securely transmitting data between parties, and users are authorized using a public/private key pair.
* **SAML:** It is a standard Single Sign-On format (SSO) where authentication information is exchanged through XML documents that are digitally signed.
* **OpenID Authorization:** It verifies user identity based on an authorization server's authentication.
* **OAuth:** It allows the API to authenticate and access the requested system or resource.

Since we’ve got a fair understanding of the authentication and authorization system, let’s just quickly jump to the aspects that define the quality of the authentication system.


## 8 Characteristics to Evaluate the Quality of Authentication System 


### #1. Functional Stability

One of the essential characteristics of a robust authentication system is functional stability. The authentication system, or in other words, a CIAM solution, must strictly adhere to functional completeness, correctness, and appropriateness. 

Considering the new security challenges, the CIAM solution must adapt to the diverse security environment and offer stringent security in every situation.For instance, the LoginRadius CIAM offers [Risk-based Authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/risk-based-authentication/) (RBA) that automatically kicks in and adds another layer of authentication in a hazardous environment. 


### #2. Reliability

A CIAM solution offering authentication and authorization must be reliable enough to meet the ever-expanding security and infrastructure requirements. 

For instance, if the number of users signing up or logging in suddenly surges, the CIAM should be capable of handling peak loads without posing a threat to crucial consumer and business information. 

Here’s where LoginRadius CIAM plays a vital role. The [LoginRadius CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/) delivers a flawless performance coupled with the auto-scalable infrastructure that automatically scales according to the business requirements in real-time.
