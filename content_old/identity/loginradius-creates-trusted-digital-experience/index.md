## Introduction

In a modern digital world where competition is neck-and-neck, creating a frictionless consumer experience should be the top priority of every business striving for success.

Brands that are delivering trusted digital experiences without compromising overall security are the ones that are highly preferred by consumers worldwide. 

Moreover, amid the global pandemic, the way brands incorporated technology into their business and established frictionless interactions with consumers, the role of a robust consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution can’t be overlooked. 

Today, enterprises must be aware that the secret to success lies in quickly identifying and eliminating any troubles and pain points that occur when consumers interact with their organization (whether through website or application).

Here’s where the role of a cutting-edge CIAM solution like [LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/) comes into play. 

Let’s understand how LoginRadius paves the way for brands to deliver trusted digital experiences. 


## Security is Essential, Consumer Experience is Good - LoginRadius Gives You Both! 

Adding stringent layers of security seems pretty unfair in a digital world where consumers are always on a hunt for a personalized and flawless user experience.

But that doesn’t mean that security can be compromised to deliver a rich user experience on a web application or a website.

Statistics show that[ 69% of internet users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1172265/biggest-cloud-security-concerns-in-2020/) are concerned about data loss/leakage and 66% are worried about their data privacy and confidentiality.

On the other hand,[ 67% of consumers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/50-important-customer-exp_b_8295772?ec_carp=6823990201176436044) mentioned terrible experiences as a big reason for churn, but only a few complained. 

Many people think that adding a robust layer of security would certainly hamper consumer experience and negatively impact the overall consumer onboarding journey.

So, what’s the trick that helps market leaders stay ahead of the curve? How do they secure consumer data without affecting the consumer experience?

Well, the key lies in creating a perfect harmony of security and user experience through a CIAM ([Consumer Identity and Access Management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/)) solution that helps scale business growth.

Yes, here’s the point where LoginRadius comes into action!
