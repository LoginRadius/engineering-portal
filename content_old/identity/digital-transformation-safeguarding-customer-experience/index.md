In today’s digitally connected world, superior customer experience is one of the biggest drivers for company success. At the heart of that experience is personalization, which harnesses the power of digital transformation in order to create curated experiences that can drive consumer engagement and differentiation in the market.

A [recent survey by Accenture Interactive](https://www.accenture.com/t20180503T034117Z__w__/nl-en/_acnmedia/PDF-77/Accenture-Pulse-Survey.pdf) found that 48% of consumers have left a company’s website in favour of another simply because it lacked personalization, and that trend is increasing annually. This statistic means two things. First, personalization has become the priority for nearly all business. Second, consumers have more power than ever to switch brands if their experience lacks that personal touch.

However, in order to provide a personalized experience, businesses need to collect more data about their customers. 83% of consumers are willing to share their data in order to enable a personalized experience, so long as businesses are transparent about how they plan to use that data.

With that said, customers still care deeply about the security and privacy of their personal data, and organizations that fail to protect it will face a number of consequences. This is where a customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution comes in. The [LoginRadius CIAM platform](https://www.loginradius.com/) not only helps organizations collect better data about their customers, but it provides a number of safeguards to protect that data.

## How does LoginRadius store data securely?

The LoginRadius platform is built with [security as the top priority](https://www.loginradius.com/security/), incorporating the highest security standards to ensure that customer data is always protected. From client browsers to the application to internal databases, personal data is always transferred following Open Authentication 2.0 protocols through an encrypted HTTPS tunnel. Our platform also incorporates end-to-end SSL encryption, which secures sensitive customer data to prevent unauthorized access and rogue attacks.

LoginRadius [user data storage](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/loginradius-ciam-user-data-storage/) is also a key differentiator in the CIAM market. Our platform uses Microsoft Azure as the cloud hosting platform for all production environments, meaning that customer profiles are stored on this cloud platform by default. LoginRadius stores customer data in 29 global data centres, all of which feature separate firewalled databases for each client at the highest level of security, as well as a robust backup and recovery system.

## LoginRadius Security Certifications

The LoginRadius CIAM platform has hosting and data security approval for all of the most commonly used compliances:

- SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 and SOC 2
- Cloud Security Alliance CCM
- FISMA
- PCI DSS Level 1
- UK Government G-Cloud
- Australian Government IRAP

Many of these certifications involve rigorous third-party assessment of either our cloud service or our data management and security practices.

In order to [comply with the GDPR](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/loginradius-and-gdpr-compliance/), LoginRadius has worked hard to ensure that our products and capabilities are leveraged to guarantee data privacy and compliance for every one of our 3,000+ customers. Some of these features include gaining [customer consent](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2017/10/ciam-solves-gdpr-customer-consent) for access to their personal data, allowing customers to view, export, and edit their personal data at any time, and providing customers with a _right to be forgotten_ by deleting their accounts entirely.
