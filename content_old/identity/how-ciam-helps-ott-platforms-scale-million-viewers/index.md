## Introduction

The last couple of years have been great for OTT (over the top) platforms since the global entertainment and content distribution industry witnessed a paradigm shift. 

Admit it, the craze for going out for a movie on the weekend is fading out and is being swiftly replaced by enjoying your favorite series and movies at the comfort of your recliner or even your bed! 

Yes, OTT platforms have revolutionized the entire entertainment industry for good. However, specific challenges pertaining to consumer experience are still the bottlenecks of various OTT service providers.

One such major challenge among the content distribution channel is to manage the ever-surging demands of the viewers on multiple platforms. 

Today, [handling billions of identities](https://www.loginradius.com/scalability/) is a steep climb for media businesses, especially when every viewer demands an omnichannel experience. 

Here’s where an identity management solution can be a game-changer.

Let’s understand how a consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution could help OTT platforms to handle scalability-related dilemmas like a breeze. 


## CIAM and OTT — Meant for Each Other

No OTT business can give precise predictions regarding the upsurge in the number of daily signups or subscriptions in today’s era when the internet has become the second home for most of us.

Thus, businesses need to understand the importance of a robust and scalable CIAM solution that can handle a sudden rush in the number of logins or sign-ups without hampering the user experience.

With a [CIAM solution](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/#:~:text=Customer%20identity%20and%20access%20management%20(CIAM)%20is%20a%20digital%20identity,while%20securely%20managing%20customer%20identities.) like LoginRadius, you can be sure enough to deliver the best user experience to your existing clients and potential subscribers as our cloud infrastructure automatically scales to accommodate swiftly changing loads of data storage, account creation, consumer authentication, new application deployment, and more.

What’s more? You get the highest level of security through [robust authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/assess-improve-your-authentication-system/) mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication, risk-based authentication, and more. 


## Security Isn’t a Luxury Anymore; It’s the Absolute Necessity! 

Media businesses should understand that offering a great user experience through a highly-scalable infrastructure is crucial but not at the expense of [poor login](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/poor-login-concurrency-impact-ott-platforms/) and security. 

Balancing user experience with robust security is the need for OTT platforms since cybercriminals are already targeting consumer identities by exploiting weak layers of security. 

As we know, every OTT platform is handling peak loads as the number of viewers and subscribers is swiftly increasing; stringent security layers should be the top priority. 

Hence, to avoid losses worth millions of dollars and prevent brand tarnishing in the global markets, OTT vendors should immediately consider incorporating smart security mechanisms through a reliable CIAM solution.
