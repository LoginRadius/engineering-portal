They are pros at tracking and measuring global innovation and technology trends, and they use this knowledge to help businesses and corporations make strategic decisions and create business opportunities.

Our friend, James Gardner, the COO of Mapegy, shares his insights into the challenges that brought them to LoginRadius, and what’s kept our partnership successful all these years.

#### **The Situation**

Mapegy needed user management solution that can be easily implemented and deployed so they can focus their efforts and resources on innovating their own products and services. 

#### **Challenges**

The three main concerns that needed to be addressed with the user management solution were:

1. Reliability and scalability
2. Simple registration and login process for a positive user experience
3. Ability to extract valuable profile information

#### **The LoginRadius Solution**

With a flexible and customizable platform, alongside a [guaranteed 99.99% uptime](https://www.loginradius.com/availability/), Mapegy was reassured from the get-go that our solution is indeed both reliable and scalable when catering to their needs and user base as they grow. As well, our login and registration flows allowed Mapegy to provide their users with a streamlined and hassle-free login and registration process while creating [centralized user profiles with the extended data points](https://www.loginradius.com/custom-object/) that Mapegy was looking for.

This played a significant role both in improving the user experience and providing Mapegy with the necessary data in order to to better understand their users.

This also gave them the information to build their innovation graph as they continued to create and provide products that are the most relevant to their user base.
