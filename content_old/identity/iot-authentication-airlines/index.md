Airports have been increasingly dependent on digital technology in recent years. This shift had become much more apparent when the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) began to receive traction. 

IoT offers a framework or foundation upon which several devices will receive a connection to each other. Therefore, a place like an airport can integrate and coordinate different devices that are in use. 

Digital tech now plays an important role in security through IoT authentication in the airline industry. 


## Smart Airport Technology 

Airports are known to be chaotic with the passengers and flights. However, behind this chaos, there is control as well. This control is due to the extensive communication that takes place between the various groups of people involved. 

With the adoption of IoT authentication in the airline industry communication devices and mainframe, an airport is now a Smart Airport. 

Airports are adopting IoT for the following reasons: 



*   An increasing number of devices need protection through IoT authentication in the airline industry. 
*   Common people are becoming more tech-savvy as they use tablets, smartphones are other devices. 
*   Desire to create a better passenger experience. 
*   Increase in the number of travelers opting to travel by flight. 
*   Increase in the number of flights. 


## Security for Smart Airports

Airports pride themselves on strict security measures to promise maximum safety to their passengers. Although this involves multiple security checks for the passengers, airports should also pay heed to the security of the technology. 

An airport requires computers, phones, tablets, and other devices. Ensuring the protection of all these devices can prove to be a difficult task. Thus, incorporating IoT authentication in the airline industry **could prove beneficial**.

The problem may not be as uncommon as one would guess. Cyberattacks have taken place approximately [12 times a year](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks-each-year-418131) at one of the USA's biggest airplane manufacturers. Therefore, IoT offers a type of surveillance system just for their devices. 


## IoT Security Certification Framework for Aviation Systems

Through IoT applications for smart airports, one can implement two security measures: protecting devices and maintaining airplanes. 

IoT authentication in the airline industry can ensure the required protective measures on the cybersecurity front. In addition to this, it can also regulate the repairs and quality checks of an airplane.

An airplane is the sum of several devices and technology. Each piece works together to fly 200+ individuals in the air. Airports usually carry out routine checks and test each piece of the equipment. However, this tedious process need not be so long. 

With IoT overseeing the health of all the airplanes, one could receive an automatic notification or alert if something does go wrong. 

In this, IoT serves as the framework for carrying out necessary security certification. Thus, it increases the operational efficiency of the system. 


## What Exactly is Facial Recognition

Facial recognition and its implementation have been a hot topic for most governments. However, leaving aside the ethics of this technology, it can contribute greatly to security. The technology will be grouped under the [IoT authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2020/12/iot-smart-authentication/) in the airline industry if it is in use. 

This technology can map out the face of an individual and place it in a database. This data will prove vital in verifying identity and in restricting access to staff-only rooms.  

Another way facial recognition and IoT authentication in the airline industry comes together in an airport is through touchless boarding. This is a process where the passport and travel documents of passengers are not scanned. 

Instead, their faces are scanned for proof of identity. In times of pandemic-borne social distancing, this technology can help airport authorities confirm identity accurately while maintaining hygiene and safety standards.


## How Does LoginRadius Ensure an Effortless Login Experience Using IoT Authentication

LoginRadius aims to create a [safer consumer experience](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2020/07/improving-airline-customer-experience/). **The plan is to do so by incorporating** **IoT authentication in the airline industry.** The fact of the matter is that many passengers are using online portals to book tickets. 

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that bank details and identities receive the required encryption. This is possible through the IoT authentication program that is available at LoginRadius. 

The program involves authentication in two ways: 



*   **QR code:** This type of login involves scanning the QR code provided to access their account. 
*   **Personal link:** The login occurs after an individual click on the link sent to another email or an IoT device. 

With the introduction of these login options, an individual will be able to book flights safely. 

In addition to this, the collection of this consumer data should undergo proper management. This is possible through the LoginRadius Consumer Identity and Access Management. 

In addition to IoT authentication in the airline industry **for registration**, the data can be collected for further analysis. This will help airlines prioritize their consumers, as they alter aspects of the business to the consumerâ€™s liking.

In essence, the airlines will be carrying out the collection of big data through CIAM. 

The CIAM platform provides features like self-service account management, single sign-on, directory services, and others. 

CIAM acts as a centralized database aiding in improved operational efficiency. This could revolutionize the airlines' consumer service, as only a [measly 1% of consumers ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecrandell/2013/01/21/customer-experience-is-it-the-chicken-or-egg/?sh=38f67ec83557)believe they receive adequate assistance. 

[CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2019/06/customer-identity-and-access-management/) also contributes to the following airport IoT **use cases**, as well:  



*   **Bag tracking**

With the help of IoT beacons, luggage can be tracked as it moves through customs. The tracking can involve sending out real-time updates on the whereabouts of the bag. 



*   **Delays or alterations in flight**


Research shows around [$20 billion is lost due](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/how-the-internet-of-things-is-transforming-aviation/) to delayed flights leading to communication problems between the airport and consumers. With** **IoT authentication in the airline industry, it is possible to identify which airplane the passenger will be boarding and track the movement of the flight. This can reduce the confusion over flight timings and delays, making communication gaps a thing of the past.



*   **Mapping out the airport**

Airports, being large, can be overwhelming for first-time flyers. With IoT cellular network-connected devices, an individual will be able to find their flight and terminal quickly through the directory.


## Conclusion

The best aspect of IoT authentication in the airline industry or the general use of IoT is the convenience that it brings. It can ease the anxiety of a passenger as they receive reassurance that their data will not see the light of day. Tracking of luggage and decreased wait times will make the passenger experience a breeze. Therefore, IoT authentication in airlines lay the path towards the future of stress-free traveling.
