The ever-expanding modern competitive landscape demands businesses to put their best foot forward to understand their clients’ needs and know their clients. 

While every business is inching towards delivering fabulous personalized experiences to their clients, understanding consumers and their behavior are now more crucial than ever without affecting the overall user experience.

So does it mean businesses should straight away throw a registration/sign-up form with a lot of fields that can help them in better understanding their potential clients? 

Well, the answer to this question is a big no!

In a world where your biggest competitors are just a few clicks away, you cannot afford to lose even a single potential client just because you weren’t able to deliver them a flawless onboarding experience. 

Here’s where LoginRadius’ Progressive Profiling comes into play. 

Progressive Profiling helps businesses to split a potentially complicated registration process into multiple steps. So that you can capture business-critical information upfront and then slowly build out a holistic view of your consumers through subsequent actions.

Let’s understand how it works and helps to scale business growth by increasing conversion rates.

## Intent Behind Launch 

One of the biggest challenges that businesses face today is to collect relevant consumer data that they can utilize to build personalized experiences for their consumers. 

However, not everyone is interested in sharing too many details about themselves and their preferences, which is perhaps why potential consumers switch to other market players. 

LoginRadius understands that businesses need an intelligent way to collect consumer data in a way that delights potential consumers so that they are happy to share details about themselves and their preferences with the business. 

Progressive Profiling enables gradual data collection through a series of events whenever a user interacts with the brand and hence is navigated to the purchase funnel without hampering the overall consumer experience right from the beginning. 

Based on consumers’ interaction with the application, Progressive Profiling automatically requests specific information. These interaction points can be anything as per the business needs including, but not limited to: 



* At nth login
* Upon navigating to a section
* Upon clicking a link
* Upon utilizing a feature


## Final Thoughts

Implementing progressive profiling on an online platform offers a competitive edge to businesses seeking innovative ways to navigate their digital transformation for enhanced business growth.
