Today, I’m very excited to announce that [LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/) has raised $17 million Series A funding, led by ForgePoint Capital and Microsoft’s venture fund, M12. In connection with the funding, both companies will also be joining our board to further our partnership, product and innovation cycles.

Since LoginRadius’ launch in 2012, we have been relentlessly focused on customer identity and have experienced triple digital annual growth for the past two years.

This funding opens huge possibilities for the company, in terms of helping us accelerate product innovation, and to expand globally to help serve the fast-growing $20 billion customer identity market.
