## What is SSO (Single Sign-On)

[Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.loginradius.com/single-sign-on/) refers to the authentication process that allows your consumers to access various applications with a single set of login IDs and passwords and an active login session. The following are the two examples of the Single Sign-On environments:



* Consumers access multiple applications of the same provider. Consumers don't need to create and remember separate credentials for each application; they log in once and access the provider's various applications. Example: Google, Youtube, Gmail, etc.
* Employees access numerous applications daily. They don't need to create and remember separate credentials for each application; they can log in once and access various applications from the same organization. Example: HR Portal, Resource Portal, Organizational Account, etc.

Since we now know what SSO is, let’s move towards understanding how to choose the right SSO strategy for your organization.
