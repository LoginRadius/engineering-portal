## How Does Social Login Work

You don't need to do a lot for work to implement social login. Here's how it works. 

**Step 1:** The consumer chooses the desired social network provider upon entering an application.

**Step 2:** A login request is sent to the social network provider.

**Step 3**: The consumer gets access to the app once the social provider confirms the identity.
