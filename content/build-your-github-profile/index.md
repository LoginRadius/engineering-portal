Github is great, as you may already know.

But, did you ever think to make your profile attractive for potential employers, followers, recruiters, and visitors?

Let's make a better version of it.

## Github Profile Image Frame

It's up to you to decide how you want this frame — photo-less, cartoon avatar, or best explaining image.

For the best image, take a quality click; quality means not blurred, perfect lighting, and good posture.
If someone looks at the photo, it shall explain your personality.

## Github Profile Page

Github has a [feature called README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) if you do not know already.

Check out some listing of [awesome GitHub profiles](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).

To start this, first, you need to create a project that is the same as your GitHub username.

**Example:** My user name is `abhir9`, and I need to create a repo with the same name `abhir9` with a `README.md` file.

This `README.me` will act as the profile page: https://github.com/abhir9

It is the actual README file created using a repo with my GitHub username: https://github.com/abhir9/abhir9/blob/main/README.md

Here you can add your quotes, hello statement, greetings, etc. It is connected to the viewer on your behalf.

So write a short paragraph or a brief story to introduce yourself.

There are some apps from contributors that extract the information based on your profile name and share stats and charts.

- https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app
  e.g.: `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=abhir9&show_icons=true&count_private=true&theme=react`
- https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com e.g.: `https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=abhir9&hide_border=true&area=true&point=transparent&theme=react-dark`
- https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com
  e.g.: `https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?size=50&center=true&vCenter=true&width=800&height=100&lines=Namaste%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BPranam%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BKhamma%20Ghani%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BVanakkam%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BSat%20Sri%20Akaal%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BAssalam%20Alaikum%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3B`
- https://views.whatilearened.today
  e.g.: `https://views.whatilearened.today/views/github/abhir9/abhir9.svg?cache=remove`
- https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com
  e.g.: `https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=abhir9&theme=react`
- SVG Icons
  e.g.: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/ubuntu/ubuntu-plain.svg`

Many other online apps can be used per your need — e.g., how you want to decorate your profile page.

## Github Pinned Repos

Github allows you to pin up to 6 repos.

Try to pin the best of your projects' repos. Mostly, people do visit these repos if they land on your profiles.

## Greeny Contributions

There is a heat map that represents your contributions.

Heat map graph will automatically generate as per your contributions. Try to keep it greener by contributing usefully to your favorite projects.

## README for Every Project

Whether it's a minor or significant project, add a well-descriptive README file. It helps anyone clearly understand what your project does and how they can contribute if they want to.

Format it in a better way; if you don't know very much about Markdown format, you can use an online tool like https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

You can use images, screenshots, gifs, resources list, contribution guidelines, license, etc.
