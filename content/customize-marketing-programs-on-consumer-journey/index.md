User experience is the key to business success in today’s digital era, where consumers are always on a hunt for rich experiences every time they interact with a brand.

However, creating a good user experience isn’t the need of the hour; instead, creating a personalized consumer journey is what businesses need the most.

A [survey by Accenture Interactive](https://www.accenture.com/t20180503T034117Z__w__/nl-en/_acnmedia/PDF-77/Accenture-Pulse-Survey.pdf) found that 48% of consumers have switched from one service provider to another just because the former lacked personalization—and the trend is swiftly increasing.

This means that businesses that aren’t leveraging personalization for their consumers would surely stand behind their competitors.

However, businesses need data as their primary fuel for creating customized consumer journeys. This data can only be extracted through a cutting-edge consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution.

Yes, a new-age CIAM solution like LoginRadius helps businesses get valuable insights regarding consumer behavior that helps channel your resources to the right audience with relevant, targeted marketing communication campaigns.

Let’s understand how a [personalized consumer journey](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/consumer-journey-from-sign-up-to-purchase/) can help businesses stay ahead of the curve and how a CIAM solution like LoginRadius offers valuable insights for creating personalized user experiences.

## Why Personalized Consumer Journey Matters?

Every consumer that lands on a website or downloads a mobile app has to go through a sign-up process, which decides whether a company is getting a loyal consumer or just another random user.

Hence, it’s crucial for businesses to leverage user data's true potential to deliver the experience that users demand.

Whether it’s personalized suggestions based on previous search history or recommendations of products based on their interests, brands can build credibility and further enhance user engagement for more conversions.

But why is it so important to provide instant recommendations or personalized experiences to users when they interact for the first time with a brand?

Well, consumers are already interacting with established brands, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google; they know what personalized rich consumer experiences mean. Hence they expect something near to it.

As a vendor, if you have the data regarding the buyer’s behavior, you can pitch exactly the same product or service for which they have landed.
