## Have you ever thought about what the world would be like if open-source didn't exist?

It's hard to imagine a world without open source these days. Open source powers the biggest organizations of today's world. Open-source software like [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) runs most of today's servers and also powers the [Android Operating System](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>).

## Introducing Hacktoberfest 2020

#### In a gist hacktoberfest is a festival of "giving back to the community".

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software in October month run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and DEV. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

**From Official Website:**

> Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re new to development, a student, long-time contributor, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

The purpose of this month-long celebration is to get people started in open source and give back to the open-source community.

It is the easiest way to get into open source for people who have never contributed to open-source community or find it difficult to contribute.

### How to contribute to Hacktoberfest?

Anyone can contribute to hacktoberfest by registering at [hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) anytime between 1st October to 31st October.

During this time, anyone who wishes to be part of this month-long fest needs to open four quality pull requests on any of the open-source projects on Github.

### How to find Projects?

Finding projects can be a bit challenging. It can be the tools you are already using, or different tools can be used to find the issues based on various labels. Tools like [http://issuehub.io/](http://issuehub.io/) are really helpful for the same.

This year [LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/) is going to be part of Hacktoberfest by open-sourcing a lot of its projects and accepting contributions on them including its [Engineering Blog](https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog).

### Getting LoginRadius branded swags

Like I said, this year **LoginRadius** will be part of hacktoberfest and yes, we are here with some **cool swags.** We have got around **500 t-shirts** for people contributing to our open source repositories. We will soon share details on how to get LoginRadius swags as well as our open source repositories on our [Blog](https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog).

Stay tuned and **don’t forget to mention your open-source projects for us to contribute.**
