# Let's Know Something about the features of Vue.js first

Vue (pronounced `/vjuː/`, like view) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

  

## Features

-  **Approachable**
Already know HTML, CSS and JavaScript? Read the [guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and start building things in no time!

  

-  **Versatile**
An incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.

# Installing Vue.js and setting it up

The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the
[Hello World example](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vuejs/vuejs.org/tree/master/src/v2/examples/vue-20-hello-world). Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can [create an `index.html` file](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/blob/master/src/v2/examples/vue-20-hello-world/index.html) and include Vue with:

  ```html

<!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings -->

<script  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>

```

or

```html

<!-- production version, optimized for size and speed -->

<script  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>

```

The [Installation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) page provides more options of installing Vue.

  

### You can also install Vue.js using`vue- cli` but it is not recommended if you are a beginner and not yet familiar with Node.js based tools.
