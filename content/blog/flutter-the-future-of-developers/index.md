**What is Flutter ? (Technical Overview)**
Within a year, Flutter has become one of the most trending technology round the globe.It is actually an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to for developing applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.
Yes ! You heard it right "from a single codebase". 

**Recent Development**
Up until now,We could use Flutter to build a unified application for Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and the Web only. If you look at the list again, you’ll notice that one of the most used operating system is missing from the list.

Yes!! Windows is missing out there. But that omission is now being remedied, as Google has announced that Flutter for Windows is now available in alpha. And with that, Flutter has now possibly become the most cross-platform framework available for developers round the globe.

Windows support means a lot of things for all the developers out there, but arguably the biggest effect is that it’s now possible to develop an app for 6 different platforms, without the need for 6 different codebases. On top of encouraging developers to start using Flutter, it also means existing Flutter-based apps can now natively come to Windows.

1 CodeBase == Apps for 6 Platform!! OMG!! It will just reduce the struggle and time that developers devote each day to 1/6th I guess. Also We dont have to learn 6 different languages to make applications for the different platforms. Flutter is surely going to make our lives better and better.

**Concluding Thoughts**
“Flutter is beautiful, velocious, rewarding and Open because as a developer, we will have full control over our application. We can create highly powered animations that allow us to change our code and literally in real-time see them appear on the application”

Considering the importance of Flutter, it is a great choice, perhaps better than React Native and others. Flutter is all set of high standards, and undeniably sounds promising for the future.

So I feel that Flutter is going to be The Future of Developers!
**Happyyyyy coding!**
