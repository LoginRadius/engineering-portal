**What is Flutter ? (Technical Overview)**
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Up until now, you could use Flutter to build a unified application for Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and the Web. If you look closely, you’ll notice there’s a pretty important operating system missing from that list. That omission is now being remedied, as Google has announced that Flutter for Windows is now available in alpha. With that, Flutter has become possibly the most cross-platform framework available for developers.

Windows support means a lot of things, but arguably the biggest effect is that it’s now possible to develop an app for 6 different platforms, without the need for 6 different codebases. On top of encouraging developers to start using Flutter, it also means existing Flutter-based apps can now natively come to Windows.

This is proper support, too. Google has updated the Flutter toolchain to properly support the Windows CLI, along with adding the necessary Win32 shell app that contains the actual Flutter app. And just like with the rest of the platforms, if there’s something you need to do in native code, you can do that too, thanks to Flutter’s plugin system.

**Concluding Thoughts**
“Flutter is Beautiful, Fast, Productive and Open because as a developer, you’ve full control over your application. You can create highly powered animations, allow you to change your code and literally in real-time see them appear on the application, an entirely free and open source.”

Considering the importance of Flutter, it is a great choice, perhaps better than React Native and others. Flutter is all set of high standards, and undeniably sounds promising for the future.
**Happyyyyy coding!**
