Ever meet a software engineer that doesn't routinely deveop?  Well, now you have.  I'm a software engineer, I work alongside others who active add or change code daily, but I don't.  My role is just as pivotal as theirs.

## Day to Day

#### Environment Stability

I don't want to tell you how many development environments I manage, but it is greater than one.  There is a reason for it.  Trust me, people tell me all the time you only need one, but there is an exception to everything.

I make sure every environment is up and that every application, which there are multiple applications I manage, remain up without issue for tester and developers to continue to work uninterupted.

#### Fly in Work

The daily unexpected.  This is that email that comes out of no where.  Could be from someone on your team that needs assistance or could be from someone you never met before.  Which always leaves me wondering, who told them to contact me?  How do they know I'm the person that can help them?  Why does everything seem to come to me?  Breath.  Its fine.  You are the glue holding it all together.

#### Mentor

The person doing the least coding is the one who has the most time to help the entry level developers.  By help I mean guide through suggestions.  YOu don't show the answer, you guide them to finding the answer themselves.  If you don't know the answer, you work on it together.

#### Production Issue

Probably the most exciting item that comes my way are production issues.  Depending on the severity I can find myself on a call with multiple managers are varying importance.  All participants listening to what I think and what I suggest the next steps are.  Am I going to be coding the fix...maybe.  Or maybe I'm researching it and working with someone else that will complete it.  Either way the clock is ticking as the clients wait.

## Projects

I still work projects along with all that.  Is it the same amount of hours as other software engineers?  Nope.  But what I like is the variety to the day.  I'm not coming in heads down on one issue, but I have multiple items to consume my day.

Some of my projects:

1. **Improvements** - Someone has to make recommendations to management on the new tools that can improve our processes.  Some items come from the top down while others are coming from me.  This is just tools either and can be as simple as a new process to do something.
2. **Compliance** - This should strike fear in the hearts of all developers.  So much compliance it is unbelievable.  You have penetration testing, you have code standards against what you write, and you have code standards against the third party jars you use.  Let's face it, who really is keeping those up to date.  You use something till it becomes a problem.

## I Like It

I can't say this position is what I thought I'd be doing when I got into development, but I enjoy it.  I've grown with it.  Sure I spent my time coding for a while.  In some capactiy I've progressed.  The importance I feel of what I do, keeps me where I am, on the other side of being a software engineer.  Or maybe where I work just likes to give everyone the same position title because it's easier.
