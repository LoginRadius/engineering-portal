### What is Android Studio?
In recent time, Android became the world’s most popular operating system for various reasons. As an android programmer, I want to share what the android studio is? Android Studio is an IDE for Google Android Development that was launched on 16th May 2013, during Google's  I/O 2013 event. Android studio contains all the Android tools to design, test, debug and profile your application. The Android Studio uses “Gradle” to manage your project which is a Build Automation Tool. To know more, please visit the following link gradle.org

For developing your first app you need to download Android Studio for your preferred platform (Windows®, Mac OS X, or Linux) from the Android developers site. Android Studio has the ability to develop and test your application on either a real device or the emulator.
##### Android Studio has many cool features that can help you to develop your android application like : 
* Powerful code editor with smart editing and code re-factoring.
* Emulator to show your code output in various resolutions including Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and many other android phones.
* Gradle based build support.
* Maven Support.
* Template-based wizards.
* Dracula Theme Environment to enjoy your coding experience.

You can experience all the cool features by using Android Studio in-hand.
### Let's Build Something!!!
In this article, we're going to build a simple "Hello World" Android Application.
> Requirement: Make sure you have Android Studio installed. If you don't, refer to this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio). It's pretty straightforward.

To create the application, we will follow these steps through the process in a pretty painless manner.


**Step 1. Open your Android Studio after installing and this following screen appears after starting:**

Also the user can choose their desired API like which android version they want to run and then click on finish.**
