Famous tools for Machine Learning

So, before talking about the tools used by professionals for MACHINE LEARNING and DATA SCIENCE.

I would like to clear the confusions which you might have regarding these rapidly growing technologies.

In past few decades, modern technologies viz. AI, ML, big data, deep learning, etc. have gained popularity and these technologies are so interconnected due to which anyone can get easily confused.

In simple language, data science is the processing and analysis of data that you generate for various perceptions and will serve a plethora of business related purposes.

For example, when you logged in on any shopping website and starts browsing for the desired products or categories, you are generating a data which will be used by a backend data scientist to learn your behavior and as a consequence you will see the targeted deals, offers and advertisements to insist you to buy the product for which you have browsed on their website.

And machine learning is the part of data science, it creates the aspects from your statistics and algorithms to work on the data generated and extracted from multiple resources.

The data of customers can be processed by data scientist upto a certain number of customers but if the customers are in thousand or millions, then it becomes tedious for data scientist to control that massive data.

So, that is the time when machine learning comes in action. So, machine learning is the ability which is given to a machine to learn and process the data sets by its own without the involvement of human.

THERE ARE SO MANY TOOLS AVAILABLE IN MARKET NOT ONLY FOR DATA SCIENCE BUT ALSO FOR MACHINE LEARNING SOME WHICH ARE AS FOLLOW:

KNIME

It is an open source tool used for machine learning. This tool is not only based on GUI but also it doesn’t require any knowledge of programming.

This tool is generally used for data related purposes such as data mining, data manipulation, etc. Also, it processes the data by creating discrete workflows and then execution will be done. It comes with repositories that are full of various types of nodes.

These nodes are then brought to the knime portal. And, at last a workflow of nodes is created and executed.

TensorFlow
This is an open source framework and it is a blend of machine learning as well as neural network models. Moreover, Tensorflow and python are good friends.

The feature which makes this tool a prominent tool is that it works on CPU as well as on GPU.

The main application of this tool includes perception, discovering, understanding, creation and classification.

Jupyter notebook

This tool is most widely used in machine learning among all tools. This tools provide very fast processing along with good efficiency.

Moreover, Julia, Python and R are the three supported languages.

Also, if you notice the name carefully, you will find that it name is derived from the name of these three languages.

It also allows the user to share the live code in the form of notebook and to store it as well.

It can be accessed through a GUI such as winpython, anaconda navigator,etc.

SAS

It is a closed source proprietary software which is specifically designed for statistical operations in data science.

It is used by large organizations to analyze their data. It uses a base SAS programming language for performing statistical modelling.

It is used by companies and professionals. It also offers plethora of libraries which are used for statistical modelling.

SAS offers high reliability and strong support but it is highly expensive as well that’s why it is only used by larger industries.

Matlab

It is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment for processing mathematical information.

It is not an open-source software. It can facilitates statical modelling, algorithmic implementation and matrix functions of data.

In data science it is used for simulating fuzzy logics and neural networks.

If you want to create a powerful visualization, you can do it by using MATLAB graphics library.

Furthermore, MATLAB’s easy integration for embedded systems and enterprise application make it an ideal tool for data science.

Tableau

It is a data visualization software which is packed with powerful graphics to make visualization more interactive.

This company targets on those industries which are working in the field of business intelligence.

The feature which makes this software a prominent one is its ability to visualize geographical data and for plotting longitudes and latitudes in maps along with other features like interface with databases, spreadsheets, etc.

Moreover, Tableau comes with an active community where you can share your findings on the online platform.

While it is an enterprise software but they also provide a free version of their software called TABLEAU PUBLIC.

Apache Spark

This tool is used in data science which is specifically designed to handle stream processing and batch processing.

This tool provides many APIs that facilitate data scientists to make repeated access to data for machine learning, storage in SQL, etc.

It has many machine learning APIs which are helpful for data scientist to create powerful predictions with the provided data.

It offers various APIs which can be programmed using Python, Java and R.

But the most powerful combination of spark is with the SCALA programming language (based on Java Virtual Machine).

So, these were few tools used by the professionals in the field of data science and machine learning.

There are numerous tools available in the market for both of field.
