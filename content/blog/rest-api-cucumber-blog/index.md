**## What is Rest?**
Rest Stands for Representational State Transfer that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web Services.
Rest API is almost meaningless description of the most-used web service technology. A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers.

**What is BDD?**
BDD stands for **Behavior Driven Development** (BDD). Now a days many Organizations, In order to get better advantage of testing they are taking a step forward.  

 - BDD gives us an opportunity to create test scripts from both the developer’s and the customer’s perspective as well.
 - BDD uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests

**What is Cucumber?**
  Cucumber is an approach that supports BDD. It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. In BDD, users (business analysts, product owners) first write scenarios or acceptance tests that describe the behavior of the system from the customer's perspective, for review and sign-off by the product owners before developers write their codes.

**What is the Prerequisites to Test Rest API using Cucumber?**
 - Java
 - Editor (Eclipse, IntelliJ etc..)
 - Maven
 
**Steps to Install Java** 

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html  

 
Download JDK from above link and install it
Set the Environment Variable on System Properties 

    Right Click on My PC -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> Create New -> provide path of JDK

**Steps to Install Eclipse**

 - Make Sure Java is installed on your PC.
 - Use below link to download Eclipse 
    https://eclipse.org/downloads
 - Install Eclipse on your PC 

**Steps to Install Maven**

 - Use below link to download Maven
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
 - Set the environment variable.

**Configuring Cucumber with Maven**

 - Create a Maven Project. Use below navigation.
     `Open Eclipse -> File -> New -> Maven Project`
Provide Group Id and Artifact Id and click on finish. 
**Group Id:** This element indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example  `com.loginradius`  is the designated groupId for all Maven plugins.
**Artifact Id:**  This element indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name.
 - Open pom.xml file to add necessary dependencies 
  
        <dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
			<version>6.6.0</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
			<version>6.6.0</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
			<artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
			<version>4.3.0</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
    		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
			<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
			<version>7.1.0</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>

 Now we need three Important files
 - Feature file
 - StepDefination file
 - Runner file
 **Feature File:**  It's a entry point to the cucumber. We use Gherkins to write feature file. This is the file where you will describe your test in descriptive language(Gherkin uses simple English). A feature file can contains a Scenario or List of Scenario. A sample Feature file is below
 

 ```
 Feature: Login Functionality
 @validLogin
 Scenario: User Should Login With Valid Scredentials 
    Given Post Login API
    When Provide Valid Credential
    Then Status_code equals 200    
    And  response contains IsLogin equals "true"
@invalidLogin    
Scenario Outline: Email and Password Validation in Login API 
    Given Post Login API
    When Provide different combinations to "<email>""<password>"
    Then Status_code equals <statuscode>    
    And  response contains message equals "<message>"
    Examples:
    |email     		|password    | statuscode |  message      						     |
    |          		|            |   401      | Required email and password			     |
    | abc	  		|            |   401      | Email format is incorrect			     |
    | abc@mail7.io  	|			 |   401      | Required password		  			     |
    | abc@mail7.io   | password   |   401      | Email and Password combination Incorrect |
   ```
  
 Save above code as login.feature 

 - **Feature:** It specifies the name of the feature under the test.
 - **Description:** It specifies meaningful description of the feature (Optional).
 - **Scenario:** Scenario describes the steps and expected outcome for a particular test case.
 - **Scenario Outline:** Same scenario can be executed for multiple sets of data using scenario outline. The data is provided by a tabular structure separated by (I I).
 - **Given:** Prerequisite before the test steps get executed.
 - **When:** Specific condition which should match in order to execute the next step.
 - **Then:** What should happen if the condition mentioned in WHEN is satisfied.
 - **Examples:** Its a tabular format input data to pass to scenario outline.
 - **<>:** anything if you write between is variable. 

**StepDefinition:**
Now you have your feature file ready with test scenarios defined. However our job is not done yet. Cucumber doesn't know when should execute which part of code. So StepDefinition acts as intermediate to your runner and feature file. Its stores the mapping between each step of the scenario in the Feature file. So when you run the Scenario it will scan the stepDefination file to check matched glue. 
**How to write step definition:**
We have chrome extension(Tidy Gherkin) to convert your feature into step definition.  
Copy your scenario from feature file and paste it in Tidy Gherkin and click on Java Steps, copy the Java Steps
Create a new file name a StepDefinition.java and paste the Java Steps

```package com.loginradius.login
import cucumber.api.java.en.Given;
import cucumber.api.java.en.When;
import cucumber.api.java.en.Then;
import cucumber.api.java.en.And;
import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.testng.Assert.assertTrue;
import io.restassured.http.ContentType;
import io.restassured.response.Response;
import io.restassured.specification.RequestSpecification;
import io.restassured.RestAssured;

public class StepDefinition {
	private  static  final  String  BASE_URL  =  "https://www.loginradius.com";
	String email = "abcxyz@mail7.io;
	String password = "password";
	RequestSpecification request;
	private  static  Response response;
	private  static  String  jsonString;

    @Given("Post Login API")
    public void post_login_api() {
	    RestAssured.baseURI  =  BASE_URL;
		request  =  RestAssured.given();
		request.header("Content-Type",  "application/json");    
    }
    
   @When("Provide Valid Credential")
    public void provide_valid_credential() {
      response  =  request.body("{ \"userName\":\""  +  email  +  "\", \"password\":\""  +  password  +  "\"}")
						  .post("/user/login");	
    }

   @Then("Status_code equals {int}")
    public void statuscode_equals_(int agr) {
	    Assert.assertEquals(arg, response.getStatusCode());
    }
	
	@And("response contains IsPosted equals {string}")
    public void response_contains_IsPosted_equals_(String message) {
	    Assert.assertEquals(message, getJsonPath(response, "IsPosted"));
    }	

   @And("response contains message equals {string}")
    public void response_contains_equals_(String message) {
	    Assert.assertEquals(message, getJsonPath(response, "message"));
    }
    
	@When("Provide different combinations to {string}, {string}")
    public void provide_different_combinations_to_somethingsomething(String email, String password){
	    response = request.body("{ \"userName\":\"" + email + "\", \"password\":\"" + password + "\"}") .post("/user/login");
    }

	public String getJsonPath(Response response, String key) {
		String resp = response.asString();
		JsonPath js = new JsonPath(resp);
		return js.get(key).toString();
	}
	
}
```

Now we have Our Feature file and StepDefinition Ready , we need runner file to run our Test Scenario's
**Runner File:**
Runner will help us to run the feature file and acts as interlink between feature file and StepDefinition Class
Below is the code which will help you to run the tests

```
package runner;
import io.cucumber.testng.CucumberOptions;

@CucumberOptions(
		features= {"feature_files/login.feature"},
        glue= {"step_definations/StepDefinitation.java"},
        tags= "@validLogin",    // based on tags scenarios will run
        monochrome=true, dryRun=false,
		)	
public  class  TestRunner  {

}
```



Now We have Feature , StepDefinition and runner files ready, We can run the runner file to see the results.


Conclusion: Cucumber is very useful to understand the over all testing process without having coding knowledge. Since it uses simple English to write the feature file and also makes developer, QA and other stakeholders on same page before starting the actual development.
