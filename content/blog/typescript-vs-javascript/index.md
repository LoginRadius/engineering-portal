Typescript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript you can use this language for 
application skills JavaScript development also it can be executed on any browser any host and any operating system now 
people often get confused between typescript and JavaScript and they don't know what are these similarities or differences 
between these two sothis blog is all about typescript versus JavaScript. So, here we will understand how typescript and 
JavaScript are similar yet different in their own ways. 
## Quick introduction to Javascript
So first is JavaScript Now, javascript is actually a scripting language which is primarily used for creating web pages it is 
also used to enhance HTML pages and is generally embedded in HTML code now JavaScript does not need to be compiled as it is 
an in-depth language it helps to create dynamic creative and interactive web pages now javascript files are identified by the 
dot JS extension so basically this is a high-level interpreted programming language that is used to make web pages more interactive 
it also lets you implement complex and beautiful things or design on the web pages so now that you know what is JavaScript. 
Now there are two different methods to use JavaScript in an HTML file 
- The first thing that you can do is embed all the JavaScript code into the HTML code  
- You can also create a separate javascript file that can be called from within a script element which is enclosed by script tags 
So these are two different ways or methods of how you can use javascript in an HTML file.

Now why do we actually use JavaScript? javascript is the most used open-source programming language which is also used extensively 
in most of the modern web applications both the client-side as well as the server-side, it is flexible and also has a reasonably elegant 
core and enables you to use object-oriented and functional programming a JavaScript variable can have any type of values such as numbers 
string array boolean etc. but javascript is mainly known for creating beautiful web pages and applications example can be Google Maps 
So if you want to explore a specific map all you have to do is click and drag with the mouse and what sort of language could do that exactly 
it's JavaScript. JavaScript can also be used in smartwatches so we have the popular SmartWatch maker called the pebble which has created 
pebble JS which is a small javascript framework that allows the developer to create an application for the pebble line of watches in JavaScript 
not just that most popular websites like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon etc. makes use of javascript to build their websites also among things 
like mobile application digital art web servers and server applications javascript is also used to make games now a lot of developers are building 
small-scale games and apps using javascript so this was about javascript and what it actually does. 
## Quick introduction to Typescript
Now Let's move on and see what is typescript. So, typescript is basically an open source programming language that lets you write JavaScript 
the way you want to now typescript is nothing but a superset of JavaScript that compiles into simple JavaScript it is purely object oriented 
with classes and interfaces it also helps programmers to write object-oriented programs and have them compiled to JavaScript both on the server 
side and client side now for typescript we can take a variable and also specify the data type as you can see here we have specified the data 
type to be string and then you can write anything like "welcome" to head array curve which is a string and then we just print this particular 
message now what happens when you run this code, when you compile a typescript code it generates a JavaScript file where you can see that 
after the compilation of the typescript code you get the JavaScript file which provides only the variable name without the data type.
## Advantages of both the languages
A JavaScript developer should consider using typescript some of them include using the new features of ECMAScript so typescript supports new 
ECMAScript standards and transfer them to ECMAScript targets of your choice so you can use features of es 2015 and beyond like modules lambda 
functions classes the spread operator restructuring etc we also have static typing now javascript is dynamically typed and does not know what 
type of variable is until it is actually instantiated at runtime typescript has type support.  JavaScript apart from that we also have type 
inference now typescript makes typing a bit easier and a lot less explicit by the usage of type inference even if you don't explicitly type 
the types they are still there to save you from doing something which otherwise would result in a runtime error then we also have a better idea 
support now the development experience with typescript is a create improvement over JavaScript there is a wide range of ideas that have excellent 
support for typescript like the visual studio and vs code Adam sublime and IntelliJ or webstorm not just that we also have strict null checking 
in typescript so errors like cannot read property X of undefined is common in JavaScript programming so you can avoid most of these kinds of errors 
Since one cannot use a variable that is not known to the typescript compiler and finally there's also interoperability so typescript is closely related 
to JavaScript so it has to create interoperability capabilities but some extra work is required to work with JavaScript life in typescript 
Now talking about some of the benefits of using typescript 
- It is fast simple easy to learn and runs on any browser or javascript engine. 
- It is also similar to JavaScript and uses the same syntax and semantics not just that this helps the back-end developers write the front-end code faster also you can call the typescript code from an existing JavaScript code it works with existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries without any issues now the definition file with the **.ts** extension provides support for existing JavaScript libraries like the jQuery d3.js etc so typescript code can add JavaScript libraries using type definitions 
- To avail the benefits of type checking code Auto completion and documentation in existing dynamically typed JavaScript libraries it also includes features from es6 and es7 that can run in es5 level javascript engines like node js 
## Detailed comparision between Javascript and Typescript
Now let's compare these two together and see how they are similar or different from each other so talking about typescript versus javascript typescript is an 
object-oriented language whereas javascript is a scripting language also typescript has a feature known as the static typing which is not dead in 
JavaScript typescript also supports modules whereas javascript does not support modules it also supports optional parameter function whereas there 
is no such optional parameter function in JavaScript now our typescript program is composed of modules functions variables statements expressions and 
comments but in JavaScript all the statements are written within the script tag so the browser program starts interpreting all the text between these 
tags as a script tag so what you can do is inside the brackets you write tripped and then you write your JavaScript code and then you close your script 
at now talking about typescript it is new and has a relatively smaller community base whereas javascript occupies the major chunk of codes and it is 
widely accepted and used by the programming community finally typescript is an object-oriented language which makes the code more consistent clean 
simple and reusable so it is better to use typescript for large projects but the case in JavaScript is that it is mostly preferred in small coding 
projects so these were some of the aspects of comparison between typescript and JavaScript 
## Trends
If we compare the Google Trends from the past five years worldwide you can see that JavaScript definitely has been trending with a major difference so here you can see that the search for JavaScript is way more than typescript and it is still in higher 
demand but we can also consider the fact that typescript is definitely a new language right now and it is also seeing a huge growth in its field and 
people are preferring typescript / JavaScript these days because it helps you in a clear and concise coding but if we consider the trends right now 
javascript is definitely leading the way so these were some of the comparison factors for typescript versus JavaScript although typescript is a 
superset of JavaScript there are certain differences and also it has some additional features that makes it a little bit better and easier to work 
with but javascript has been ruling the world of web development since ages so you cannot set it back quite easily
## Conclusion
In simple words before technology A gets replaced by technology B technology B has to be about 10 times better and then technology A. Now, how do you quantify tentimes
better depends how you look at it, Javascript is a very old language and it has a huge community as compared to Typescript since it is a new language,
right now it is impossible to replace javascript but who knows the future !!
