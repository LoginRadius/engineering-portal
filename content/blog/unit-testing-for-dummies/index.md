A lot has been written and talked about Unit Testing in the IT industry for the last couple of years. I have heard and discussed the same over the previous 2.5 decades of my IT career. Even though a lot is talked about and is done in this field but still today, every company is struggling with this. But before we proceed with the above situation, let us first understand its importance.

A strong foundation is the basis of a strong building in the same way a proper unit testing is the foundation of high-quality software. Unit Testing, if done correctly, ensures that each of the building blocks of the software product is robust and will make high-quality software when put together.

## Why is it difficult to run a smooth unit testing procedure?

Well, it is not that a developer loves to find bugs in his/her coded code but when it comes to unit testing, they at times(most of the times) sees it has an additional overhead on them, especially when one has to follow and stick to a lot of protocols, frameworks, and documentation, etc. Also, it is commonly misunderstood that finding issues is the QC team's problem. We just have to code. In my view, it is incorrect thinking as Quality Software is common or combines commitment from a company and it's team.

## How can I run Unit Testing smoothly without getting into much of a botheration:

1. Post writing a code block, can I pass a few negative values/ scenarios to see if my code is robust enough to handle the same?

2. Is my written code fulfilling the business requirement for which I have written the code?

3. How many other application areas is my code impacting? Are the values passed from the new block causing an impact on existing areas? Here I would like to state that one has to focus more on the behavior of the existing code with new values. The earlier we do it in the coding cycle the better it is in terms of rework at the developer's end.

4. If you can follow a specific framework like Junit or Nunit etc, for conducting the unit testing is fine, but if not, you are not able to do that it does not matter as I can always pass a set of values(both positive or negative) to my written code.

5. If there is no Test case management tool for trapping the unit test values, do not worry; just make a .txt file, put the values, and outcomes in that and you can see the same on a shared drive.

6. Can I write a few automated scripts to execute the repetitive code to save time?

7. Can I show my code to my next neighboring coder to have a quick look into the same?

8. If my code involves a UI can I have a quick run-through by a BA or PM or Tester from a usability point of view?


In the end,  remember that I am the first and the most basic foundation in a big building of Quality and have to always keep the same in mind whenever I code since no one is interested to buy a well-packaged product if its ingredients are not of high quality.

By doing the above I am not only contributing to high-quality software but I can devote by later high bug-fixing time in things like improving the performance/security of my code and avoiding going back to the drawing board for issues related to performance or security etc. Always remember in the Software development unit testing serves as "A stitch in time saves nine".
