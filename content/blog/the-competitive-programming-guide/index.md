Competitive Programming!!! The key to get into FAANG(Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and a dream of every coder.

In this article i will walk you through some steps to master the competitive programming and get into the big giants!

We will start with the basics.

### **Step 1\. Learn a programming language:**

This is the first step to our journey to master competitive programming.
Pick any programming language and start coding!
Just grasps all the basics of the programming language and practice on platforms like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) , [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/). Practticng on these platforms will make you basics strong.

If you are a beginner you can start with C or Python. 
So, Just start with any programming language and learn its basics.

Once, you are done with the basics, you are ready for the next step.

### **Step 2\. Learn a OOP:**

Must be wondering what is OOP? OOPs is the Object-Oriented Programming which helps you imagine and relate you program with the real world using classes and objects(Dont worry if you dont know about these!!). 

OOPs is very important when it comes to applying our code for the real world. So, after the basics just work on your OOPs concepts and master them.

If you are a C programmer, try learning C++ or Java. Many programmers prefer C++ ffor competitive programming. Butt you can choose yours favourite!

### **Step 3\. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

So once we are done with the basics and you have sufficient knowledge about a programming language,
Now its the time to become an intermediate at this by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

Data Structures and Algorithms are the most important as they optimize your code.

>Any fool can write code that a compouter can >understand, Good programmers write code that humans >can understand. - Martin Fowler

Data structures and algorithms are the base of comapetitive programming. The one who master it will conquer the competitive programming.

Knowledge of Data sturctures and algorithms helps you optimize your code so that it takes less time and space for a very large real world inputs.

So learn all of them and practice.

### **Step 4\. Practice, Practice and Practice:**

Omce you have learned the concepts you have to start applying them. Practica as much questions as you can. 

You can also participate in the coding contest held by many platform and gain rating and stars.
These ratings and stars will decide how good you are at competitive programming and these will help you to form the habit of sloving coding questions in a limited time and will help you gain experience.

Some of platforms are [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/),[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/),[Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/).

Happy Coding!
