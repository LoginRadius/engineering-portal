Competitive Programming!!! The key to get into FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and a dream of every coder.

In this article i will walk you through some steps to master the competitive programming and get into these big giants!

We will start with the basics step by step.

### **Step 1\. Learn a programming language:**

This is the first step to our journey to master competitive programming.
Pick any programming language and start coding!
Just grasps all the basics of the programming language and practice on platforms like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) , [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/). Practicing on these platforms will make your basics strong.

If you are a beginner you can start with C or Python and learn its basics.

Once, you are done with the basics, you are ready for the next step.

### **Step 2\. Learn a OOP:**

Must be wondering what is OOP? OOPs is the Object-Oriented Programming which helps you imagine and relate your program with the real world using classes and objects(Dont worry if you dont know about these!!). 

OOPs is very important when it comes to applying our code for the real world. So, after the basics just work on your OOPs concepts and master them.

If you are a C programmer, try learning C++ or Java. Many programmers prefer C++ ffor competitive programming. But you can choose yours favourite!

### **Step 3\. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

So once we are done with the basics and you have sufficient knowledge about a programming language,
Now its the time to become an intermediate at this by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

Data Structures and Algorithms are the most important as they optimize your code.

>Any fool can write code that a compouter can understand, but Good programmers write code that humans can understand. - Martin Fowler

Data structures and algorithms are the base of competitive programming. The one who masters it will conquer the competitive programming.

Knowledge of Data sturctures and algorithms helps you optimize your code so that it takes less time and space for a very large real world inputs.


### **Step 4\. Practice, Practice and Practice:**

Once you have learned the concepts you have to start applying them. Practice as much questions as you can. 

You can also participate in the coding contest held by many platform and gain rating and stars.
These ratings and stars will decide how good you are at competitive programming. These will also help to develop the habit of solving coding questions in a limited time and will help you gain experience.

Some of platforms are [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/).

Happy Coding!
