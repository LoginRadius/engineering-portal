Generally, MIM attacks are breaking to believe the traditional encryption technologies and targeting the intermediate nodes between the sender and receiver.

## What is a MIM attack?

MIM stands for man-in-the-middle. In the World of Cybersecurity, a man-in-the-middle attack (MIM) is an attack where the attacker breaks into the middle of the network pathway silently such that the sender and receiver are not able to intercept and they believe they are directly communicating with each other. One such example of a MIM attack is active eavesdropping. In this example, an attacker can be sitting with a piece of software somewhere in the network path and capturing all the relevant network traffic for later analysis. The attacker can intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and by smartly monitor and alter old ones or inject new ones. It can become complicated and arise problems for the organization.

## Does the question arise how about using SSL and Virtual Private Networks?

SSL and Virtual Private Networks do not always protect messages as they travel across intermediary pathways. So, that where virtual dispersive networking comes into the picture.

VDN follows the approaches or methods of traditional military radio spread spectrum security. Radios rotate through the frequencies randomly, and communications are divided or split into multiple pieces (or streams). So now, only one receiving radios are programmed to reassemble these pieces into their original form. 
VDN divides the original message into some multiple parts, and it will encrypt each component separately and routes them over many servers, computers, and even mobile phones. The data also move out dynamically to optimum paths â€” both randomizing the paths the messages take while simultaneously taking into the server congestion or other network issues.
When it comes to the role of Hackers, they are left scrambling to find out data parts as they go through like data centers, Cloud, Internet, and so on. 

## Why Virtual Dispersive Networking?

1. Unparalleled Security: Dispersing the data over multiple different paths, eliminates the Man-in-the-Middle threat. Hackers can only obtain a small chunk of the original data on any given pathway, rendering any data obtained meaningless and nearly impossible to decrypt.
2. Network Resilience: Suppose a connection is lost on any of the several pathways due to network failure,
data packets are then rerouted to an already existing path, or an additional path is established which leads us resulting in negligible network downtime.
3. Speed / Performance: Since the data-flow is from multiple independent paths using unique methods, it increases available bandwidth and optimizes data flow on individual pathways. Therefore, speed and performance are improved.

## Conclusion

Today, Dispersive Technologies' business is largely government-centric, with initial forays into commercial industries with high-value targets like banks and utilities. There are many opportunities for Dispersive technology in the cloud computing world. The cloud can host the redirects at the center of their methodology without much of a stretch. However, cloud conditions can use Dispersive to set up secure communications between clouds or between on-premise information. These hybrid cloud situations regularly rely on VPNs, which will, in general, be flaky and moderate. Dispersive Technologies have become replacement of VPNs, thereby improving the security, performance, and manageability of hybrid clouds as well as virtual private clouds. 

As with any industry, change can be frightening (especially when sensitive data is part of the equation), but if the organization is aware of the new developments, they can begin implementing some of these security technologies into their existing IT infrastructure and enjoy some peace of mind without worrying about future threats.
