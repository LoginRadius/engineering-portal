Agile is becoming another SDLC methodology but in reality, it is beyond normal project management. With time It’s been accessorized a lot and leaving behind the basic building blocks and the important entity the **Agile Development Teams**. 

Does anybody want a product full of bugs, non-scaleable, difficult to maintain?, certainly No.
No matter whatever the agile framework we use, the ultimate goal is a wonderful product with complete customer satisfaction. And it's the developers who sit in the centre and build the product and are responsible for the quality.

**<p style="text-align: center;">Agile + Development Team = Agile Development Team</p>**

## What is Agile Development Team

Before that let’s see who are the developers and what is a development team. A developer is a proficient individual in his technical skills. And a group of such individuals working on a project/product makes a development team. Then how does an Agile Development Team differ? 

The three attributes bring that difference.

*“A group of proficient individuals who are cross-functional, autonomous and self-organised sharing the same goal of building a bug-free product or delivering the project with proven quality”*

## Cross-functional

This doesn’t mean that every team member is *'master of all'* or even a *'jack of all trades'*. In fact, every individual carries their proficiency. But the important thing is that each team member is capable of building additional skills and as and when required can be applied during the development journey.

It reduces the dependency and overall predictability increases and gives better room for risk management. 

## Self-organised

There is no right or wrong way to organise and hence sometimes teams fail. This attribute of the Agile development team gives freedom based on the maturity of the team to organise and plan the work for themselves. If in scrum team plans the daily work on their own. No one assigns the work.

This helps in prevailing the high motivation, team members can better innovate and work towards the quality of deliverables. They can act without escalations without any unnecessary commands and control.


## Autonomy

This brings the sense of ownership, a mental state when the team feels the accountability of the results. Team members voluntarily take ownership and make themselves responsible for the results of the product and project deliveries. Team members collaborate, work together, learn and share the feedback with an open mind. Help each other and grow together.
