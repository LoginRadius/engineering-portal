# Let's build Github profile

Github is great, as we already know.
But, did you ever have a thought to make your profile attractive for potential employers, followers, recruiters, visitors.

So let's make a better version of it.

### Github Profile Image Frame
its up to you , how you want this frame, photo less or cartoon avatar or best explaining image.

For the best image, take a quality click, quality means not blurred, perfect lighting, good posture.
If someone looks at the photo, it should explain your personality.

### Github Profile Page
Github has [feature](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) for readme, if you do not know already.
Checkout some listing of [awesome github profiles](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).

To start this , first you need to create a project that is the same as your github username.
eg: My user name is `abhir9` then I need to create a repo with the same name `abhir9` with a `README.md` file.

This `README.me` will be your profile page,
https://github.com/abhir9/abhir9/blob/main/README.md
https://github.com/abhir9

Here you can add your quotes , hello statement , greetings etc. this is connected to the viewer on your behalf.
So write a short paragraph, a brief story about yourself to introduce yourself.

There are some apps from contributors, which will extract the information based on your profile name and in result will share stats, charts. etc

- https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app
   eg:  `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=abhir9&show_icons=true&count_private=true&theme=react`
- https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com
- eg: `https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=abhir9&hide_border=true&area=true&point=transparent&theme=react-dark`
- https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com
    eg: `https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?size=50&center=true&vCenter=true&width=800&height=100&lines=Namaste%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BPranam%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BKhamma%20Ghani%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BVanakkam%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BSat%20Sri%20Akaal%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3BAssalam%20Alaikum%20%F0%9F%99%8F%3B`
- https://views.whatilearened.today
    eg: `https://views.whatilearened.today/views/github/abhir9/abhir9.svg?cache=remove`
- https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com
    eg: `https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=abhir9&theme=react`
- SVG Icons

There are many other apps as well online , which can be used as per you need , how you want to decorate your profile page.

### Github Pinned Repos
Github allows you to pin upto 6 repos only.
Try to pin best of your projects repo, mostly people do visit these repos if redirected to profiles.

### Greeny Contributions
There is a heat map which represents your contributions.
Heat map graph will automatically generate as per your contributions. Try to keep it more green by your contributions (but not the other way around).


### Every Project Readme
Whether it's a small or major project, add enough descriptive readme file.
Format it in a better way , if do not know very much about md file format, can use any online tool, eg: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html
Can use images, screenshots, gifs, resources list, contribution guidelines, licence etc.
