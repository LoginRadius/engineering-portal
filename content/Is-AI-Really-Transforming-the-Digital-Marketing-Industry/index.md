Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting technologies in the business world. Many businesses are using AI to drive important business decisions ([Read for more info](https://dminc.com/articles/how-to-use-ai-to-drive-business-decisions-for-your-enterprise/)), and it can do a variety of different things, as well.

However, because the technology is new, there are also a lot of questions about it. One common question that comes up is the role of AI in the digital marketing space and if it is changing the landscape of the industry.

The simple and quick answer is yes. Artificial intelligence truly has the potential to change and transform digital marketing. Digital marketing [is a massive industry](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-digital-advertising-and-marketing-industry-301093781.html) already, and the growth in AI will only improve it.

But how? Well, that is exactly what this blog post is going to look at. Read on to learn just how AI is transforming the digital marketing space.

## An Improved User and Consumer Experience

A major way that [ArticiaI intelligence](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/how-ai-is-going-to-change-your-iam-initiatives/) can transform the digital marketing space is by providing an improved user experience. AI can allow marketers to gain deeper access to the needs, behaviors, and journeys of their consumers. It can even help with predicting different behaviors and purchasing motivators.

Using AI, you can continuously gain access to new or improved insights that can improve your marketing efforts and how you reach people. You can learn how people like to be marketed to, what works best, and use analytics to help fine-tune your marketing.

The more you know, the better the journeys will be able to be tailored. If what you offer can match up well with what your audience or potential consumers expect, it can be incredibly beneficial.

## Increased Personalization in Marketing

Personalization is a hot topic for businesses. Everything from products [to marketing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-personalize-marketing-li) needs to take personalization into account. People want to feel like companies truly value them as individuals, not just as another sale.

If some consumers don’t feel like you are reaching out to them directly, they may not be receptive to the message you are providing. The use of AI in digital marketing allows everything to be much more personalized and customized.

With AI and machine learning, you can essentially have built-in tools for making decisions and deciding the right marketing strategy to use. The more data you have, the better this machine learning will work, and soon enough, it will be able to come up with the best way to target specific groups of individuals.

## AI Can Save Companies a Ton of Money and Time

In addition to helping the consumer side of the industry, AI also has the potential to improve things on the marketer side of things drastically. A lot of marketing in the past was done through a lot of guessing, testing, and adjusting to get things right. Even today, many companies will test dozens of potential strategies to see which works.

Many of these technologies will learn as they go and won’t require any sort of human intervention by using AI. Using previous data, they will be able to determine which methods are likely to be most fruitful and which won’t be. As you could imagine, this frees up a lot of employee hours to focus on more pressing issues.

While all artificially intelligent tools and software aren’t always cheap, they are certainly more affordable than paying a team to test different strategies to see what works.

In conclusion, yes, AI is transforming the digital marketing industry. We hope the information in this [marketing growth blog](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/) has been able to show you how. <p>
