With blogging, there are no limits. Blogging is a platform to think and execute  ideas that can lead to your big break. Blogging can help you reach thousands of people out there who share similar interests and mindset as of yours.

Now that you are anxious to start blogging, which brings back my track to my topic, here is the step by step guide for developers to start their own blog.

**Step by Step blogging guide for developers**

Becoming a pro-blogger won’t happen overnight, it requires some serious efforts and continuous dedication, but once done, it will take your career to a whole new level.

### **1\. W\*\***hat to blog about\***\*?**

The niche of your blog is the most crucial part of your blogging journey. You can’t just start writing about anything, after all just writing is not enough to make your blog successful.

The simplest way to make your writing remarkable is to select the topic which  you are Passionate about or is Good at it. If you are writing on something you are not passionate about, after sometime you will start losing interest at it, eventually Blogging.. Once you are done with deciding the good topic, the next step is to find the suitable domain name.

### **2\. Find the perfect domain name**

Picking up a perfect domain name is very important since it will be the first point of contact between you and your audience. Always make sure that your blog name is easy to remember, short and easy to spell. There are two approaches here :

- You can put your name as domain name like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/), [Phil Haach](http://haacked.com/), [Paul Irish](http://www.paulirish.com/), etc.

- In the next approach, you can decide to name your domain in such a way that it gives readers an idea about what this blog is about. Here is an example [Coding Horror.](http://blog.codinghorror.com/)
- If both the approaches aren't satisfying, you can opt for any name but don't forget to implement [SEO Practices](http://backlinko.com/seo-techniques) for that blog.

Whichever approach you use, make sure it is not too complicated or very long. Readers must be able to remember it without much additional efforts. Check out this [article](http://www.successfulblogging.com/how-to-come-up-with-a-blog-name/) to know more on how you can grab perfect domain name. Once the domain name is picked, you need to host your website on a particular CMS. I am a big fan of Wordpress in this case, thanks to its amazing functionality and easy to customize features. Though you can also try other platforms like [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com/), etc.

### **3\. Design your blog with perfect theme and plugins**

Nobody can deny the fact that Looks are important ! With an elegant yet attractive theme, impress your visitors on their first date with your blog. Don’t go with a default theme, instead try multiple themes in order to find out the best one. Every theme has its own pros and cons so make sure you do enough research and have Trials, before settling for one.

Here are some points you need to take care of while selecting a theme :

- Theme must be Responsive i.e., it must perform well on all kind of devices.
- Theme must match your blog niche.
- Don’t forget, Simplicity works best!
- Customize Theme Menus and Widgets as per your needs.
- Make sure the fonts are easy to load and read.
- Theme must not be too clumsy.

After selecting the theme, install required plugins that will work as an add-on and optimize your blog. Here are [top Wordpress plugins](https://blog.bufferapp.com/best-wordpress-plugins) that every blogger needs. Also don’t forget to make your blog Social Media Friendly by including Social Tools such as [social sharing widgets](http://www.social9.com/), social based commenting, like box,  etc.

### **4\. Grab your social media name before it’s gone**

The next step is to pick up your name across various social media networks. It will not only protect your reputation but also prevent shady marketers to use your name for wrong reasons. Additionally, it will also expand the reach of your name. It’s great to have a strong presence where your audience hangs out as it will make it easier for them to find you.

So create genuine social media profile and share interesting content to make your blog successful and drive traffic.

### **5\. Content is the King\*\***!\*\*

Here comes the most important factor! No matter how attractive your blog is, content is what will make them stay. Pick up some interesting topic related to your blog niche and start writing your first post.

Write about what you know and also do additional research to make your point more clear. Provide important links that can justify your points in a better way.

Here are some points that you need to take care of while writing a blog post :

- **Write a catchy headline**! The headline of your post must create curiosity among readers. You can add multiple emotions here like fun, humor, controversy, etc.
- **Explain every point in detai**l. Don’t worry about the length of blog, make it as long as it needs to be.
- **Divide your blog** in short paragraphs, use bullet points, highlight links and headlines.
- **Include visuals** like images, infographics, videos, etc to grab reader's attention.
- Use **simple and easy to understand language**.
- **Don’t make any grammatical errors.** Proofread your blog before publishing it.

### **6\. Make your blog optimized for Search engines**

Once you are done with the writing, optimize it for search engines. Here are some tips that will help you :

- **Include meta descriptions** : Meta descriptions are displayed under your post title in SERP (search engine results pages) so make sure it provides users an idea on what your blog in about. An effective meta description will improve [Click through rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate).
- **Optimize the blog for keywords** : NEVER, I say, NEVER stuff a lot of keywords into a single post as it might get you penalized from search engines. Limit yourself to 2-3 keywords for one post. Instead of using tons of keywords, you can try your hand on long tail keywords too.
- **Use H tags** : Make sure to use H tags for your post titles. Use only one H1 tag on one page and maintain the sequence.
- **Optimize images** : Don’t use oversized images and even if you have to, compress them before including in your post as oversized images will decrease your blog speed. Also, as search engines are not able to read visuals, make sure to use relevant alt tags with every image.
- **Use SEO friendly URLs** : URL structure of your blog must be easy for the readers to understand your blog structure. The url should be able to make readers understand what the content is about. Search engine love user friendly urls. Here are some tips a. Keep the urls short and simple. b. The url should not contain dynamic parameter like www.abc.com/p?567/ .     Instead optimized your post url as per the content like   www.abc.com/blogging-tips/ c. Make sure to use Hyphens (-) instead of underscores (\_) in URLs.

Optimizing your blog for search engines is very important as it’s the place from where most of your visitors will arrive on your site.
