Programming is an excellent exercise for your brain as programmers deal with never-ending situations like bugs, compiler, issues, deadlines, languages, etc. During all these times, other than the phenomenal codes, we produce MEMEs and a hell lot of MEMEs

MEMEs can light the environment for every programmer in the world. On that note, there is a famous saying-

**“If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in – Edsger Dijkstra”**
