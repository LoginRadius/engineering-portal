Gone are the days when learning coding or programming was reserved for the geeks or nerds. The case is exactly different nowadays. The latest buzz of “How to code” is here to stay. Making sure that you have little coding knowledge under your belt is proving to be an incredible skill no matter whether you are a marketer or an entrepreneur or a member of any of business team. Talk to any entrepreneur, marketer or freelancer, you will get an idea about learning coding will help you get through. The reasons are more than one! Half of the 2016 is gone, so if you haven’t included this incredible skill in your 2017’s new year resolution, you need to reconsider. Here is why!

### **Why?**

With softwares ruling the digital world, the demand of learning coding is becoming must for every professionals in every field whether it is marketing, technology, commerce, finance and what not. As the digital age is making us more and more dependant on computer softwares for business, learning to code has become helpful here. Learn to code is already in the must have technical skills list of 21st century and this demand of technical skills is growing like never before.

Coding is problem solving. Coding is no different than the way you can fuel up your car, check the oil and get it serviced by reading the manual you are provided with. But coding takes you a long way ahead. It is beyond these simple things. It teaches you to repaint your car, customize the engine to make it work in the way you want. Hope you got an idea why coding is important and why you should also learn it.

### **You are convinced! Now what?**

- Did you know Bill Gates, got into programming at a very early age? The reason being his prep school used to provide students access to GE Mainframe Computer.
- Similarly the owner of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, hired a private programming tutor to learn the same while growing up.

Yeah, yeah, I know this coding thing is not the only factor behind their success (or should I say making them billionaire), but it didn’t hurt either.

But unlike them, most of us were not gifted with this kind of exposure to the digital world and most of us are still naive to how the world of programming works. Many of the people around are still wondering how to write and combine the long string of code to create a beautiful website, app and more! And trust me you are not alone!

But don’t worry because with so many information available online, you can also master the same. No need to spend a lot of money or put yourself in debt in coding learning, as these resources are definitely going to help you to get through this.

Most of the courses I found here were free, but to get a verified certificate you need to spend some cash which differs between the type of courses you are enrolled with.
