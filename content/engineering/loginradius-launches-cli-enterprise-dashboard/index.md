## Introduction 

As a developer, I like to work on the terminal. Many developers are the same way. Instead of scrolling, clicking the mouse, they prefer working with only keywords (through commands or shortcuts). The command-line interface (CLI) is a great tool for them.

So, LoginRadius has launched a CLI for its enterprise dashboard. The CLI makes it easier by using some commands to perform different operations and manage the flow of the LoginRadius Enterprise dashboard.


## The Idea Behind LoginRadius CLI

We always look for ways to eliminate resistance from the process of working with LoginRadius. Therefore, we have taken this step to introduce LoginRadius CLI for a better developer experience.

In the 1970s and 1980s, most users preferred to use command-line interfaces. As time passed, we shifted to graphical user interfaces. GUIs are user-friendly; however, CLIs are faster than GUIs. Here is an example of adding domain via Admin Console v/s CLI :

To add a domain through LoginRadius Admin Console, you need to:  \




1. Navigate it to Web Apps in LoginRadius Admin Console
2. Click on Add 
3. Enter the domain 
4. Click on Save

On the flip side, you can do this by running a single command:
