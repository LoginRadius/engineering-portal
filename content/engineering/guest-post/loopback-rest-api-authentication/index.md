Authentication and authorization are critical in every software application to secure user data and allow access to trusted users. In some cases, implementing authentication and authorization is not an easy process.

However, LoopBack 4 offers an authentication package **@loopback/authentication** that helps secure your application's API endpoints. It provides custom authentication strategies and a **@authenticate** decorator that requires minimal boilerplate code.

## What is LoopBack?

According to the [LoopBack 4 documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/index.html):

> LoopBack is a flexible, open source Node.js and TypeScript framework built on Express. It helps you quickly develop APIs and microservices built on backend systems such as databases and SOAP or REST services.

Loopback provides several features that allow you to build your application with less boilerplate code.

## What is JSON Web Token (JWT)?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard [defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519.html).

It is a standard used for securely transferring claims between two parties over the internet. It uses JSON Web Signature (JWS) for the secure transfer of claims and eliminates the possibility of tampering. Accordingly, JWTs can be signed with either a secret (HMAC technique) or a public/private key pair (RSA or ECDSA).

In simple words, it is used for authentication and secure information sharing. A JWT token is made up of three components that are separated by three dots:

- **Header:** The header is made up of two parts â€” the kind of token, which is JWT; the signature technique used, either HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
- **Payload:** The payload is the token, which includes the claims. Claims are assertions about an entity that provides extra information.
- **Signature:** The encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm provided in the header comprise the signature.

> You can learn more about [JWT and its best practices here](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/guest-post/jwt-authentication-best-practices-and-when-to-use/).

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is a hands-on demonstration. To follow along, be sure you have the following in place:

- A Linux machine â€” This tutorial will use Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa). The tutorial also works well on other Linux distributions and operating systems.
- [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/) â€” JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) â€” Document-oriented database program.

## Install LoopBack CLI

To start building your LoopBack REST API, first install LoopBack CLI, which provides the quickest method to create a LoopBack 4 project that follows best practices.

Use the command below to install the Loopback CLI globally:

```bash
npm i -g @loopback/cli
```

You can grab a cup of coffee while you wait for the installation to complete. Then open your command line, create an `AuthWithLooback` folder, and change the directory to the `AuthWithLooback` folder with commands below:

```bash
mkdir AuthWithLooback
cd AuthWithLooback
```

## Scaffold Your LoopBack Project

So, you've installed Loopback CLI and created a project directory. Let's run the following command to create a LoopBack project:

```bash
lb4 app
```

Select the options as in the following screenshot to complete the prompts.

![Creating a loopback project](l5wg0nTQ.png)

After completing the prompts, LoopBack will configure the TypeScript compiler and install all the required dependencies. Change directory to the `auth-with-loopback` folder.

```bash
cd auth-with-loopback
```

## Create a Model

You've successfully created your Loopback application. Now, letâ€™s create a Model to store the news details with the command below:

```bash
lb4 model
```

Select the options as in the following screenshot to complete the prompts.

![Creating a News Model](lSCGXHs.png)

After the `date_created` property definition, press the enter key to exit the prompt.

Loopback will create a `NewsModel` file in the `src/models` â€” the folder where `NewsModel` will be defined.

Next, you need to create a data source to connect to your preferred database. For demonstration, this tutorial connects to a MongoDB database.

Run the following command in your terminal to create a data source:

```bash
  lb4 datasource
```

Select the options as in the following screenshot to complete the prompts.

![Creating News datasource](pHvPgEQA.png)

After completing the prompts, LoopBack will create the `News` file in the `src/datasource` folder.

Then, create a [Repository](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Repository.html) for CRUD operations of your NewModel with the command below:

```bash
lb4 repository
```

After completing the prompts, LoopBack will create the `NewsModelRepository` file in the `src/repository` folder.

Select `NewsDatasource` as the data source, `NewsModel` as the model for generating the repository, and `DefaultCrudRepository` as the base repository class.

Your selection for the prompts shall look like the screenshot below.

![Creating News Repository](WWH5tYJQ.png)

After completing the prompts, LoopBack will create the `NewsModelRepository` file in the `src/repository` folder.

Lastly, create a controller for the `NewsModel` you created with the command below:

```bash
  lb4 controller
```

Your selection for the prompts should look like the screenshot below.

![Creating News Controller](iHD6lPCg.png)

After completing the prompts, LoopBack will create the `NewsController` file in the `src/controller` folder. So far, your project structure, omitting the `node_modules` folder, should look as follows.

## Add Custom Data

Now that you have the Model setup, run the server, and add some custom data to the News collection in MongoDB.

```bash
    #start the server
    npm run start
```

The above command will start the TypeScript compiler, which will build the project and check for possible errors. If everything goes well with the code, you should see the output on the terminal, as follows:

![Starting LoopBack Server](lSCGXHnw.png)

Next, open your favorite browser and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see an output as follows:

![LoopBack API Dashboard](hL9y8IIg.png)

Now, click on the explorer link, where you can make requests to your LoopBack application. On the explorer page, locate the post endpoint and add some custom data to the news collection by clicking the `try it out` button with the data below on the request body.

```json
{
  "title": "Upgrade to Loopback V4",
  "body": "The developers of Loopback urges the V3 users to upgrade to V4 as soon as possible",
  "date_created": "2021-12-14T00:57:43.197Z"
}
```

Then, click the `execute` button to run the query.

![Executing Queries](jiC_1P0A.png)

You can add as many records as you like to experiment with the endpoints. The important thing to note here is that the endpoints are not protected. Anyone may create, read, update, and delete records.

In a moment, this tutorial explains how to secure the endpoints so that only logged-in users can access them.

To begin, install LoopBack `authentication` and `authentication-jwt`, as follows:

```bash
  npm i --save @loopback/authentication @loopback/authentication-jwt
```

## Setup Authentication Components

To protect the application, you'll implement user authentication and authorization, which implies that only logged-in users will be able to access your APIs. You'll create two endpoints in the User controller:

- `/Signup` endpoint: To handle userâ€™s sign up.
- `/Login` endpoint: To handle userâ€™s login.

### Create Your Signup Endpoint

Youâ€™ll start with the signup controller to enable users to create an account. Create an empty controller with the command below:

```bash
    lb4 controller
```

Your selection for the prompts should be as follows:

![Creating User Controller](6LCgT-Gw.png)

Then, open the `src/controllers/user.controller.ts` file, and import the required modules with the following code snippet:

```javascript
    import { authenticate, TokenService } from '@loopback/authentication';
    import {
      Credentials,
      MyUserService,
      TokenServiceBindings,
      User,
      UserRepository,
      UserServiceBindings,
    } from '@loopback/authentication-jwt';
    import { inject } from '@loopback/core';
    import { model, property, repository } from '@loopback/repository';
    import {
      get,
      getModelSchemaRef,
      post,
      requestBody,
      SchemaObject,
    } from '@loopback/rest';
    import { SecurityBindings, securityId, UserProfile } from '@loopback/security';
    import { genSalt, hash } from 'bcryptjs';
    import _ from 'lodash';
    ........
```

Next, set up your user credential objects, and verify the user credentials using the `UserService`, injecting `MyUserService` into the `authentication-jwt` extension.

```javascript
    @model()
    export class CreateUser extends User {
      @property({
        type: 'string',
        required: true,
      })
      password: string;
    }

    const UserSchema: SchemaObject = {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['email', 'password'],
      properties: {
        email: {
          type: 'string',
          format: 'email',
        },
        password: {
          type: 'string',
          minLength: 6,
        },
      },
    };

    export const RequestBody = {
      description: 'The input of login function',
      required: true,
      content: {
        'application/json': { schema: UserSchema },
      },
    };

    export class UserController {
      constructor(
        @inject(TokenServiceBindings.TOKEN_SERVICE)
        public jwtService: TokenService,
        @inject(UserServiceBindings.USER_SERVICE)
        public userService: MyUserService,
        @inject(SecurityBindings.USER, { optional: true })
        public user: UserProfile,
        @repository(UserRepository) protected userRepository: UserRepository,
      ) { }
    ..........
```

Finally, you'll build your signup endpoint, which will listen to POST requests. Here, you shall save the hashed version of the user's password in the database to keep it safe.

```javascript
     @post('/signup', {
      responses: {
        '200': {
          description: 'User',
          content: {
            'application/json': {
              schema: {
                'x-ts-type': User,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    })
    async signUp(
      @requestBody({
        content: {
          'application/json': {
            schema: getModelSchemaRef(CreateUser, {
              title: 'NewUser',
            }),
          },
        },
      })
      newUserRequest: CreateUser,
    ): Promise<User> {
      const password = await hash(newUserRequest.password, await genSalt());
      const savedUser = await this.userRepository.create(
        _.omit(newUserRequest, 'password'),
      );

      await this.userRepository.userCredentials(savedUser.id).create({ password });

      return savedUser;
    }
    .........
```

### Create Your Login Controller

Now that you've set up the signup endpoint, create the login endpoint so that registered users may log in to the API.

Using the code snippet below, set up the login route in the `src/controllers/user.controller.ts` file. In the event of a successful log-in, a token is sent to the user.

```javascript
      @post('/signin', {
      responses: {
        '200': {
          description: 'Token',
          content: {
            'application/json': {
              schema: {
                type: 'object',
                properties: {
                  token: {
                    type: 'string',
                  },
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    })
    async signIn(
      @requestBody(RequestBody) credentials: Credentials,
    ): Promise<{ token: string }> {
      const user = await this.userService.verifyCredentials(credentials);
      const userProfile = this.userService.convertToUserProfile(user);
      const token = await this.jwtService.generateToken(userProfile);
      return { token };
    }
```

Perhaps, you can show the currently logged-in user by adding a `/whoami` endpoint.

In the `src/controllers/user.controller.ts` file, get the details of the currently logged-in user using the code snippet below. Users should access this endpoint only when they are logged in.

```javascript
      @authenticate('jwt')
      @get('/whoami', {
        responses: {
          '200': {
            description: 'Return current user',
            content: {
              'application/json': {
                schema: {
                  type: 'string',
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      })
      async whoAmI(
        @inject(SecurityBindings.USER)
        loggedInUserProfile: UserProfile,
      ): Promise<string> {
        return loggedInUserProfile[securityId];
      }
```

Now, open `src/application.ts` and bind the authentication components to your application class. First, import Loopback `AuthenticationComponent`, `JWTAuthenticationComponent`, and `NewsDataSource` from your `datasources` using the following code snippet:

```javascript
//...
import { AuthenticationComponent } from "@loopback/authentication"
import {
  JWTAuthenticationComponent,
  UserServiceBindings,
} from "@loopback/authentication-jwt"
import { NewsDataSource } from "./datasources"
//...
```

Then, mount the jwt authentication system and bind your `NewsDataSource` to the `UserService` data source.

```javascript
//...
// ------ ADD SNIPPET INSIDE THE CONTRUCTOR BLOCK ---------
this.component(AuthenticationComponent)
this.component(JWTAuthenticationComponent)
this.dataSource(NewsDataSource, UserServiceBindings.DATASOURCE_NAME)
//...
```

Finally, add the authenticate action in the Sequence. Also, modify the error when authentication fails to return status code 401 (Unauthorized). Open the `src/sequence.ts` file and add the code snippet below:

```javascript
    import { FindRoute, InvokeMethod, MiddlewareSequence, ParseParams, Reject, RequestContext, Send, SequenceActions, SequenceHandler } from '@loopback/rest';
    import {
        AuthenticateFn,
        AuthenticationBindings,
        AUTHENTICATION_STRATEGY_NOT_FOUND,
        USER_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND,
    } from '@loopback/authentication';
    import { inject } from "@loopback/core"
    export class MySequence implements SequenceHandler {
        constructor(
            @inject(SequenceActions.FIND_ROUTE) protected findRoute: FindRoute,
            @inject(SequenceActions.PARSE_PARAMS)
            protected parseParams: ParseParams,
            @inject(SequenceActions.INVOKE_METHOD) protected invoke: InvokeMethod,
            @inject(SequenceActions.SEND) protected send: Send,
            @inject(SequenceActions.REJECT) protected reject: Reject,
            @inject(AuthenticationBindings.AUTH_ACTION)
            protected authenticateRequest: AuthenticateFn,
        ) { }
        async handle(context: RequestContext) {
            try {
                const { request, response } = context;
                const route = this.findRoute(request);
                //call authentication action
                await this.authenticateRequest(request);
                // Authentication successful, proceed to invoke controller
                const args = await this.parseParams(request, route);
                const result = await this.invoke(route, args);
                this.send(response, result);
            } catch (error) {
                if (
                    error.code === AUTHENTICATION_STRATEGY_NOT_FOUND ||
                    error.code === USER_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND
                ) {
                    Object.assign(error, { statusCode: 401/* Unauthorized */ });
                }
                this.reject(context, error);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Protect News Endpoints

So far, you've implemented user authentication for your API. Now, protect your News endpoints so that only authenticated users can access those routes.

Open the `src/controllers/news.controller.ts` file, and import `authenticate` from jwt authentication.

```javascript
import { authenticate } from "@loopback/authentication"
```

Then on each of the endpoints in your news controller, add `@authenticate('jwt')` before the `NewsController` class, which will protect all the routes in `NewsController`.

```javascript
    //...
    @authenticate('jwt')
    //...
```

Perhaps, you may not want to protect all the routes, simply add the `@authenticate('jwt')` method before the route you wish to protect. You can protect the POST route as follows:

```javascript
    @authenticate('jwt')
    @post('/news-models')
      @response(200, {
        description: 'NewsModel model instance',
        content: { 'application/json': { schema: getModelSchemaRef(NewsModel) } },
      })
      async create(
        @requestBody({
          content: {
            'application/json': {
              schema: getModelSchemaRef(NewsModel, {
                title: 'NewNewsModel',
                exclude: ['id'],
              }),
            },
          },
        })
        newsModel: Omit<NewsModel, 'id'>,
      ): Promise<NewsModel> {
        return this.newsModelRepository.create(newsModel);
      }
```

## Test Your Application

You've implemented user authentication in your REST API and secured the routes against unauthorized users. Let's put your application to the test. Press `CTRL-C` to exit the server and restart it with the following command:

```bash
    npm start
```

If you open the explorer page, you should see the `UserController` endpoints.

![User Controller Endpoints](IaV4R43g.png)

If you try to execute any query on `NewsController`, you get a 404 (Unauthorized) error. So, sign up by clicking the `/signup` endpoint â€” and log in from the `/users/login` endpoint. On successful login, copy the token, scroll to the top, click on the `Authorize` button, and paste the token.

![Authorizing Users](atU6nqmA.png)

Now you can execute queries on the `NewController` endpoints.
