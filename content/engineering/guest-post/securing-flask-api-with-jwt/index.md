Authentication is an essential part of any web application. But unfortunately, it is not always easy to implement.

## What is Authentication?

Authentication is a process of verifying that an entity is who they claim to be. For example, a user might authenticate by providing a username and password. If the username and password are valid, the system will check if the user can access the resource. After the system checks the user's details against its database and if the details are valid, the user is thus authenticated and can access available resources.

## Authentication Factors

The following factors are used to authenticate a user.

### Single-factor Authentication

This authentication is used when a user provides a username/email/phone number and a password. This is the most common and weakest authentication factor. The user simply inputs the email and password, and the system checks if the data is valid; if valid, the user gets authenticated and can access the resource. What happens if another person who is not a legitimate user tries to access the resource? The system denies access to the resource.

### [Multi-factor Authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-factor-authentication/)

This authentication uses more than one factor to authenticate a user. For example, the user tries to log in with, say, email and password; if the data is correct, a code is sent to the user's phone number, and the user is asked to input the code. If the user enters the code, the user gets logged in; otherwise, the user is not authenticated. Some applications even go a step further by not using two factors but using three factors.

## Types of Authentication

There are three types of authentication, as follows:

1. **Knowledge Authentication**: The user is asked something that only they can provide or know -- e.g., password. This is the most common type and also the easiest.
2. **Property Authentication**: The user is asked for something they own or possess. For example, they can use a hardware authentication device like YubiKey or an authenticator app on their phone. The idea is that users will be asked to set an authentication factor that verifies the identity more securely. This isn’t always used alone; it’s used alongside another authentication type, say, `Knowledge authentication`.
3. **Biological Authentication**: The user is asked to verify their identity using something biologically unique to them -- e.g., a fingerprint or iris scan.

In most applications, knowledge and property authentication are used as an extra layer of authentication.

## Authentication vs. Authorization

The following are the differences between authentication and authorization:

1. Authentication verifies identity (usually through credential validation)) while authorization grants or denies permissions to a user.

2. Authentication is used to verify that users are who they say they are. Authorization is used to verify that a user has permission to do something.

## Starter Application

In this tutorial, you'll work on authentication middleware for an existing API built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [PyMong](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)o. The API is a book library API using which users can create books and upload cover images for the books and relevant data. PyMongo is used to connect to the mongo database. You'll use the [PyJWT library](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate and verify JWT tokens.

> You can learn [more about JSON Web Tokens (JWT) here](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/guest-post/jwt-authentication-best-practices-and-when-to-use/).

To get started, clone the repository and set up the application by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LoginRadius/engineering-blog-samples.git # Clone the repository
cd /Flask/loginRadius-flask-auth # change directory
python3 -m venv env # create virtual environment; if you're using Windows, `py -m venv env`
source env/bin/activate # activate virtual environment, if you're using windows, env/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies
# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
```

The application is now set up and ready to run. You can run the app using the command `flask run` in the project directory. You can test that all the endpoints are working by testing the app in an API testing tool, like Postman.

## Authentication Middleware

As you've noticed, anybody can access the API; you need to restrict access to the API. Create new book data if they have the correct data, then add, delete, and update book data, but you don't want that. To do this, you need to implement an authentication middleware.

Middlewares are created in Flask by creating a decorator; a function can have multiple middlewares, and the order matters a lot.

To create your auth middleware, you need to install PyJWT -- the library you'll use to generate tokens. You’ll also use Pillow to alter image data before saving them to disk. Run the following command to install the packages:

```bash
pip install pyjwt pillow
```

You need to add a secret key to your application; this is what you should pass to JWT.

Add the following to your `app.py` file below the app declaration.

```python
# app = Flask(__name__)

SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'this is a secret'
print(SECRET_KEY)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = SECRET_KEY
```

Let's create a file called `auth_middleware.py` in the root of your application and place the following inside this file:

```python
from functools import wraps
import jwt
from flask import request, abort
from flask import current_app
import models

def token_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        token = None
        if "Authorization" in request.headers:
            token = request.headers["Authorization"].split(" ")[1]
        if not token:
            return {
                "message": "Authentication Token is missing!",
                "data": None,
                "error": "Unauthorized"
            }, 401
        try:
            data=jwt.decode(token, current_app.config["SECRET_KEY"], algorithms=["HS256"])
            current_user=models.User().get_by_id(data["user_id"])
            if current_user is None:
                return {
                "message": "Invalid Authentication token!",
                "data": None,
                "error": "Unauthorized"
            }, 401
            if not current_user["active"]:
                abort(403)
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "message": "Something went wrong",
                "data": None,
                "error": str(e)
            }, 500

        return f(current_user, *args, **kwargs)

    return decorated

```

The function above is simply a decorator function. Inside this function, you check if there is an `Authorization` field in the headers part of the request; if this is missing, you return an authorization error.

Next, you check if it exists but is not valid; if it is not valid, you also return an authorization error.

If everything goes fine, then the view function is called. As you can see, you return `f(current_user, *args, **kwargs)`, where `f` is the next decorator or function that's being called after this decorator -- in your case, the view function, which means that the first argument of any view function that uses this decorator must be `current_user`.

## Auth Routes

You currently have a route to creating a new user, but you don't have one to log in. From what you have above, you're checking if the token passed as the header is valid, but now the question is -- how do you get to know the token. Basically, the login route fetches the token and sends it to the client.

Add the following function below the `add_user` function:

```python
@app.route("/users/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():
    try:
        data = request.json
        if not data:
            return {
                "message": "Please provide user details",
                "data": None,
                "error": "Bad request"
            }, 400
        # validate input
        is_validated = validate_email_and_password(data.get('email'), data.get('password'))
        if is_validated is not True:
            return dict(message='Invalid data', data=None, error=is_validated), 400
        user = User().login(
            data["email"],
            data["password"]
        )
        if user:
            try:
                # token should expire after 24 hrs
                user["token"] = jwt.encode(
                    {"user_id": user["_id"]},
                    app.config["SECRET_KEY"],
                    algorithm="HS256"
                )
                return {
                    "message": "Successfully fetched auth token",
                    "data": user
                }
            except Exception as e:
                return {
                    "error": "Something went wrong",
                    "message": str(e)
                }, 500
        return {
            "message": "Error fetching auth token!, invalid email or password",
            "data": None,
            "error": "Unauthorized"
        }, 404
    except Exception as e:
        return {
                "message": "Something went wrong!",
                "error": str(e),
                "data": None
        }, 500
```

## Protecting API Routes in Flask

So far, you've been able to create your auth middleware, but you need to use this middleware to protect routes. All you need to do is to pass this middleware immediately after the `app.route` middleware, then make `current_user` the first argument of the view function, as follows:

```python

@app.route('/')
@token_required
def user(current_user):
  return jsonify(current_user)

@app.route('/<pdt_id>')
@token_required
def product(current_user, pdt_id):
  return jsonify(Product.find({'user_id': pdt_id}))

```

Add this middleware (`@token_required`) to every function you only want authenticated users to access. In the end, your whole `app.py` file should look as follows.

```python
import jwt, os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from save_image import save_pic
from validate import validate_book, validate_email_and_password, validate_user

load_dotenv()

app = Flask(__name__)
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'this is a secret'
print(SECRET_KEY)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = SECRET_KEY

from models import Books, User
from auth_middleware import token_required

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

@app.route("/users/", methods=["POST"])
def add_user():
    try:
        user = request.json
        if not user:
            return {
                "message": "Please provide user details",
                "data": None,
                "error": "Bad request"
            }, 400
        is_validated = validate_user(**user)
        if is_validated is not True:
            return dict(message='Invalid data', data=None, error=is_validated), 400
        user = User().create(**user)
        if not user:
            return {
                "message": "User already exists",
                "error": "Conflict",
                "data": None
            }, 409

        }, 201
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "message": "Something went wrong",

        }, 500

                "data": None,

            }, 400
        # validate input
        is_validated = validate_email_and_password(data.get('email'), data.get('password'))
        if is_validated is not True:
            return dict(message='Invalid data', data=None, error=is_validated), 400
        user = User().login(
            data["email"],
            data["password"]
        )
        if user:
            try:

```

Before running the application, let's look at the `save_pic` function inside the `save_image.py` file. This is the function responsible for saving uploaded pictures.

```python
from PIL import Image
import secrets, os
from flask import current_app as app

def save_pic(picture):

You should also add the following functions as helper methods of the `User` model class.

```python
def disable_account(self, user_id):
    user = db.users.update_one(
        {"_id": bson.ObjectId(user_id)},
        {"$set": {"active": False}}
    )
    user = self.get_by_id(user_id)
    return user

def encrypt_password(self, password):
    return generate_password_hash(password)

def login(self, email, password):
    """Login a user"""
    user = self.get_by_email(email)
    if not user or not check_password_hash(user["password"], password):
        return
    user.pop("password")
    return user

```

Your `models.py` file should look as follows:

```python

Here's an example of the user request:

```
{
     "name" : "abc xyz",
     "email" : "xyz@gmail.com",
     "password" : "Abc@123"
}
```

Here, the name should have two words, and the password should have at least an uppercase later, a lower case letter, a digit, and a special character.

And an example of the book request:

```
{
    "title":"name of book",
    "cover_image": "path to image file locally",
    "category": "['romance', 'peotry', 'politics', 'picture book', 'science', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'thriller'],
    "description":"description",
    "user_id":"user_id"
}
```

While passing a book request, pass it via the `form-data` tab in Postman.

## Conclusion

This article has explained authentication and how to authenticate a Flask API with JWT.

In some cases, handling authentication yourself may not be good enough or efficient -- to overcome this, you can simply use third-party authentication providers like LoginRadius. You can check out this [tutorial](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/tutorial/python/) to learn how to add LoginRadius to your Flask application.

You can find the complete code for this article on [Github](https://github.com/LoginRadius/engineering-blog-samples/tree/master/Flask/loginRadius-flask-auth). You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bkoiki950) if you've any questions.
