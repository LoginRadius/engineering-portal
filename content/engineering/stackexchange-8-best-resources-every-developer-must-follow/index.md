As a developer, you should be familiar with [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/). There are tons of resources available on there about software development and programming. Out of everything, I have compiled a list of the top 8 resources that I find helpful. These resources cover a wide range of topics such as web development, general programming, and best practices to follow during development.


**1.** [**Technical things to remember when doing the live (production) deployment of the web application**](http://ish.re/HDPA)

In this resource, you’ll get a checklist of the things that will make your web application deployment go smoothly as well as how to get good feedback from your users/search engines. It covers many topics such as user interface, user experience, security, SEO, browser compatibility, design, etc.

**2.** [**Why can’t software industry deliver faultless projects quickly?**](http://ish.re/HDPE)

Have you ever compared the software industry with other industries such as retail, telecommunications, etc.? The article above covers many of the differences and gives tips around how, as a developer, you can focus on the issues related to software.

**3.** [**How can I review my own code?**](http://ish.re/HDPF)

Have you ever reviewed your code? It’s always a fun thing to do…  Coding standards and code quality are equally important factors that feed into software quality. In this thread, you’ll find best practices for self-code review that will help improve the quality of the overall software or web application.

**4.** [**Must read books for programmers**](http://ish.re/HDPJ)

Books are useful for everyone, regardless of your profession. They impart plenty of information into your brain, which you then process and output as a skill. In this thread, you’ll find a list of helpful books to read as a developer. You can choose what to read based on the technology and system you are familiar with, but my personal favourite is “**code complete**.”

**5.** [**How to improve programming skills?**](http://ish.re/HDPL)

We, programmers, are always looking to improve our coding skills, but sometimes only writing code is not enough. This thread has some tips and tricks for how you can improve.

**6.** [**Should I become a polyglot programmer?**](http://ish.re/HDSM)

This thread will help you understand the benefits of learning additional programming languages as a way to improve your thought processes. Understanding more language designs makes you a sharper developer.

**7.** [**Selection between “Do it right” and “Do it ASAP”**](http://ish.re/HDSX)

Have you ever been in a tricky situation where you are caught choosing between whether to make the software the right way or to finish it quickly for an upcoming deadline? Well, you are not alone! All developers face the same problem. Go through this thread to understand and choose the right approach for you.

**8.** [**For fun: list of programmers cartoons**](http://ish.re/HDPR)

Developers enjoy writing software and feel a deep sense of satisfaction when the program they've been working on is executed nicely and goes to production. That is the essential part of our life, but sometimes we can afford to take a break from all the coding and enjoy some nerdy cartoons… Here are some that I like.
