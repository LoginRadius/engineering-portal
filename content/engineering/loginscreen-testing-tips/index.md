A **login screen** is a web **page** or an entry **page** to a web/mobile application that requires user identification and authentication, regularly performed by entering a username and password combination. 
The login process is the most essential feature for any system/application as it provides access to an entire **web-site/application** or part of it. So, testing of the login screen needs complete coverage.

Mentioned below are few tips that can be referred for testing the login screen of any system/application.

**UI/UX:**

 - Tab Order - Check if there is a logical order for using the tab key
 - Focus on Username field - Check if, while landing on the page, the cursor is at the username field 
 - Use of enter key - Check if Login button is activated on selecting enter
 - Accessibility - Check if all the fields on the page are correctly identified and labeled
 - Look & Feel - Check if the page looks fine, and everything is aligned correctly.
 - Content - Check if the content of the page is up to the mark. Are there any typos in the labels, controls of the screen?
 - Links - Check if the page contains any existing links, and are these links still valid.
 - Responsiveness - Check the responsiveness of the login screen in multiple sizes of computer monitors.

**Security Checks:**

 - Password - Check if the password shown or hidden(using asterisks)
 - Password - Check if you can copy & paste the password from other applications.
 - Password - Check if there is a minimum complexity on the password
 - Password - Check if there is a 'Show password' option that is there or not. If yes, then check if it is working fine.
 - Common Password Lookup - Check if the login screen is performing a lookup in the list of the most common passwords ([CommonPasswordsList](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords))
 - View Source - Check the source code of the application and check if any valuable information given away in the HTML source code
 - SQL Injection - Check if the login page is vulnerable to SQL input
 - Pages - Check if you can access the other pages of the application without logging in.  
 - URL Manipulation - Check if you are able to access the other pages of the application by editing the URLs, to gain access where it should not be allowed (without login).
 - Multiple accounts - Check if by using different accounts, you can be logged in at the same time in the same browser
 - Cookies - Check if you can edit and/or disable the cookies.

**Functionality:**

 - Login - Check the login functionality with valid/invalid credentials and without providing credentials.
 - Logout - Check the logout functionality. Check on logging out; the user is logging out completely.
 - Forgot password - Check if the forgot password option is available or not. And if it is there, does it work correctly. Also, check if it is prone to a security failure or URL manipulation
 - Back and Forward buttons - Check how the application copes when using the browser's 'Back' and 'Forward' buttons.
 - Remember me - Check if there is a "Remember me" option. And if it is present, then does it work as standard. Also, check what happens if the password is changed.
 - Compatibility - Check the Login/Logout functionality with all possible valid/invalid cases in other browsers.
 - Data - Check the username & password fields for data validation (Is there a minimum or maximum length of characters, boundary-values, what are the allowed characters, etc.).
 - Error handling - Check how various errors are handled and displayed (for negative cases).
 - Javascript-off test - Check if the login form still works when JavaScript is disabled.
 - 2FA Check - Check the login process when two-factor authentication is being provided; then test with valid/invalid token, test with valid/invalid backup code, test lockout procedure, and test recovery process.

**Thanks for reading and happy testing!**
