## What is a Cyber Attack?
A cyber attack is a sequence of actions performed by the cybercriminal in order to obtain unauthorized access to a computer, computer networks, or other computing systems, steal data, or harm innocent people or launch additional attacks from a compromised computer. To launch a cyberattack, cybercriminals utilize a range of methods, including phishing, ransomware, malware, man-in-the-middle attack, and denial of service, among others.

## 10 Types of Cyber Threats

### 1.Phising 
Phishing is the practice used by scammers to steal users' credentials or sensitive data such as credit card numbers or to install malware on the victim's machine. by sending fraudulent communications that appear to be from a reputable source. In this case, scammers send users emails or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, complete with bogus hyperlinks. 
 
### 2.Dos/DoDs 
DoS and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overwhelm a system's resources or networks and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to respond to valid queries, It reduces the system's ability to perform. This attack is frequently used to set up another attack.

### 3. Voice Phishing Or Vishing  
Vishing - a combination of voice and phishing. Vishing is a type of cybercrime that involves the use of a phone to steal personal and confidential information from victims. Vishing is a type of social engineering attack since it relies on psychology to convince victims to give sensitive information or perform an action on the attacker's behalf.

### 4.Malware  
Malware attacks are common types of cyberattacks in which malware (usually malicious software) performs unauthorized actions like stealing personal, financial, or business information on the victim's system. Malicious software also known as a virus which include ransomware, spyware, command and control, and others.

### 5.Ransomware  
Ransomware is a type of virus or malicious software that threatens to expose or limit access to data or a computer system and encrypts data or system functionality. Cybercriminals demand money in exchange for releasing the system after encrypting the data or locking it. A deadline is typically attached to the ransom demand. If the victim does not pay the ransom on time, the data will be lost permanently, or the ransom will be increased.


### 6.Man - in - the - Middle 
A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and distributes messages between two participants who think they are interacting directly. Both participants who send emails, messaging, or video conferencing are not aware that an attacker has inserted themselves into the conversation and is collecting their information.

### 7.Brute Froce 
A Brute Force Attack is an attempt to match a credential, such as a password, using the power of computers. Automated spraying of all possible character combinations and lengths into a password field until a match is made constitutes such an attack. Brute force attacks are successful when the authentication protocol of an online service complements this type of attack. Shared secrets between the service and the user provide the highest probability of success for a brute-force attacker.

### 8.IoT Devices  
Any cyberattack that targets an Internet of Things (IoT) device or network is known as an IoT attack. Once the device has been hacked, the hacker can take control of it, steal data, or join a network of infected devices to execute DoS or DDoS attacks.

### 9.Spyware & Keyloggers  
A Keylogger is a spyware that logs a user's activity by logging keystrokes. Every key pushed on the keyboard is captured and forwarded to the hacker when Spyware installs a keylogger on a device. As a result, the hacker will have to search through streams of data to find user passwords, other credentials, and other sensitive information. Keylogger spyware is generally installed on the user's device by a user to click on a malicious link or attachment.


### 10.Cross Site Scripting  
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks use third-party online resources in which malicious scripts are inserted into a legitimate and innocent website or application for obtaining a user's information. For XSS attacks, attackers commonly employ JavaScript, Microsoft VBScript, ActiveX, and Adobe Flash can also be used. XSS attacks happen when a hacker uses an online application to send malicious code to a different end-user, usually via a browser-side script. The weaknesses that allow these attacks to succeed are prevalent and can be discovered whenever a web application receives user input without validating or encoding it in its output.


### To Conclude. 
Cyberattacks are becoming more complicated and diverse, with a distinct type of attack for each evil goal.
While cybersecurity preventative tactics vary by attack type. We need to follow [best security practices](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/cybersecurity-best-practices-for-enterprises/) and basic IT hygiene for mitigating these attacks.

These cybersecurity threats are creating more fear in organizations to stack their security measures. However, organizations are faceing the challenge of securing their infrastructures, application, users data from cyber threats. they can follow [Security Tips]("https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/tips-from-loginradius-security-expert-2022/") which follow by the LoginRadiusâ€™ Cybersecurity Experts.
