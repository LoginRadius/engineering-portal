### Hello, Deno

Deno is a new platform for writing applications using JavaScript and TypeScript. It is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust.

Denoâ€™s lowest level binding layer to the system is tied to promises (called **ops**). Deno is secure by default, provides first-class TypeScript support, has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector, and supports third-party modules such as **lodash** .


Btw, this is the best damn geeky one-liner code to explain what is Deno. Totally cool.

### Installation

Deno works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Deno is a single binary executable and it has no external dependencies.

Open a new terminal and run `deno`. You should get a `>` prompt. Type `exit`.

After installing deno on your system we just need to create a simple **Hello World** program by using the following steps :

Step 1. Create a Folder as per your project name by using command prompt


```
mkdir HelloWorldDeno
```


Step 2. Create a typeScript file and name it **index.ts.**

Step 3. Add the following code in **index.ts.**


```ts

const helloWorld = (name: string = "world") => {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!!`);
}

helloWorld();

helloWorld("Friend");

```



Step 4. Run the following project by using the following command


```
deno run index.ts
```

You can check the result here
