Writing test cases (which is an important task for a tester in application testing) requires experience and a keen eye for detail to build scenarios. This means that an application tester needs to focus on creating a set of variables or conditions which will help him to determine whether the software meets requirements and functions lawlessly. To reduce that hassle, we have compiled a list of use cases that you need to test a signup or login page.
We hope they will help you to create more error-free Register/Login pages.



## Before We Start


You should gather all the customer requirements you can. The list of requirements which can be useful are:
1. FirstName
2. Confirm Password
3. LastName
4. Address
5. UserName
6. PhoneNumber
7. Email ID
8. Gender
9. Password

Required fields are:
1. Email ID 
2. UserName
3. Password
4. Confirm Password 


Validation for fields:
1. Email
2. Password: It should have alphanumeric, Length should be 8 to 32.
3. PhoneNumber: Phone Number should have only Numbers, Country code is required

After successful Verification email should send to the user
On Required fields * should show.
Now, let’s begin with our test cases. Although most testers use Bugzilla or other test management tools to maintain test cases, you can also use Excel or spreadsheets.

• Username and password are mandatory fields

## Conclusion

You need to think like an end-user for writing the best test cases and getting different scenarios of what will happen in real circumstances. If you install this creativity and perceive the product with the eyes of an end-user, you will certainly be closer to creating an error-free application.

BE A PERFECTIONIST. HAPPY TESTING!
