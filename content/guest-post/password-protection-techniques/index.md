The techniques we can use to protect our password are

**Using different passwords for each and every sites:** 
Most of the people use same password for every applications or places for security purpose. So what happens is whenever there is attack and password is stolen, the attacker can access every application used by the victim. If the users uses different passwords for different places, so upon compromising the password of one place will not affect other places.

**Using 2 step authentication factor wherever feasible:**
What happens in 2 step authentication is, whenever one tries to login or attack with a password, the system or application will generate an One Time Password (OTP) and sent it to your Gmail or phone number to authenticate.

**Avoid using dictionary words or regular pattern passwords:**
Passwords like iloveyou123 or chocolate143 or qwerty123 should be avoided. A simple brute force can reveal you password leading to data breach. 

**Passwords should be combination of all characters and should be long:**
A unique password with a combination of upper case, lowercase, numbers and special characters which are long (more than 10 characters) can keep your applications and system secure.
But in such cases, passwords like Qwerty@123 and other should not kept as they are easy to crack.

**Always use a VPN when using public Wi-Fi:**
Using a VPN (Virtual private network) will encrypt the users Internet traffic, so that your passwords will remain safe against any 3rd party spy.

**Downloading a password manager**
It is nearly impossible to remain all the passwords when using unique one for every place. A password manager will keep all the login credentials and other sensitive data properly and safely.
