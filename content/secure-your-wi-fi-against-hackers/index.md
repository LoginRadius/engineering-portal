Wi-Fi is utilized by people globally since it has become an integral part of our fast-paced everyday lives. But, there's no such thing as 100% security or being hacker-proof. However, there are simple steps you can take to safeguard your [privacy and data security](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/consumer-data-privacy-security/) that are pretty easy and straightforward.

  

This particular article will discuss some tips to reduce the likelihood of hackers stealing your personal data when you connect to Wi-Fi.

## What is Wi-Fi

  

Wi-Fi is a modern technology that uses a wireless networking connection. It allows devices like computers, laptops, mobile, or others to share its network with other networking devices.

  

These days, internet connectivity occurs via wireless routers. Therefore, when you access Wi-Fi, you will be connecting to a wireless router which allows your Wi-Fi-compatible devices to interface or link with the internet.

  

Wi-Fi is not an acronym. Instead, the brand name is designed by a marketing firm meant to serve as a middleware seal for commercializing efforts.

## How Wi-Fi Works

  

Wi-Fi uses radio waves to impart information between your device and a router via frequencies. Two radio-wave frequencies are utilized depending on the amount of data being sent.

  

The two Wi-Fi frequencies are separated into multiple channels to prevent high traffic and interference. When you access the network on your device, the information you provided is converted into binary code, which is the language of the computers.

  

Next, the Wi-Fi router connected to the device receives frequencies that travel across the radio station. Finally, the router receives the data through a hardwired internet cable.

  

Some changes and routines can be implemented that protect you from intruders, snoopers, and internet carpetbaggers. You should always make a control if anyone gets on your network.

  

The next problem is the signal footprint. If anyone can pick up a signal from your router, they can also grasp data and gather all the passwords.

  

Following are the ten tips to ensure your Wi-Fi is private and blocking hackers.

## How to Ensure Your Wi-Fi is Blocking Hackers

### 1. Change username and password frequently.

Passwords play an important role in maintaining security. Regularly, you can change the username and password because there is no rule regarding how often you change the router password.

  

You can also access your router’s configuration page via a web browser connected to your network.

  

-   Enter a typical router address.
    
-   Enter your router’s username and password.
    
-   Open the Wireless section provided.
    
-   Now create a new password using letters, numbers, and special characters. A [strong password](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/password-security-best-practices-compliance/) can contain at least eight characters long.
    
-   Finally, save your changes so that you can connect to your wireless network using your new password.
    

  

Modern Wi-Fi routers include the ‘Guest network’ option with its SSID and password. In this case, you don’t want to share your primary password. Meanwhile, guests can also connect to the Internet with their devices.

### 2. Turn on the Wireless Network Encryption.

[Encryption](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/encryption-and-hashing/) is the security process that clambers the information that you send over the Internet. Most of the Wi-Fi routers have built-in encryption. You can set your security type using wireless encryption like WPA and WPA2.

  

-   You can log into your router’s settings and select the wireless network configuration section on the wireless security or wireless network page.
    
-   Then select WPA or WPA2 option and click Save and Apply option.
    
-   To make the changes, you may reboot the router.
    

  

### 3. Use a VPN.

VPN is commonly known as Virtual Private Network (VPN). They provide primary security benefits that protect your router from interloping. Use of Wi-Fi hotspots in public places along with VPN will preserve your device from spammers.

  

Hackers may also use “Man-in-the-middle” to plunder your data that is connected to the same network. When you use this device in the home, the possibility of targeting your router is high.

  

-   Open settings and select Wi-Fi & Internet or Wireless & networks.
    
-   Select the VPN option.
    
-   Enter server address, username, and password, which the network administrator provides.
    
-   Make use of one of the prominent VPN with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://nordvpn.com/download/social-site/">NordVPN</a>.
    

### 4. Hide your network from view.

Whenever you set up a connection with a password, ensure that the network is hidden from view. Hiding your network will help you to block visitors from getting on the network.

  

Open settings, select basic wireless settings from menus, set SSID Broadcast to disabled, and click the save settings option to hide your SSID.

  

Some issues relating to not hiding could be extensive use of Wi-fi which could result in DNS error. You can <a rel="nofollow" href="https://routerlogin.mobi/dns-error-80710102/">fix DNS Error 80710102</a> by disabling universal plug-n-play or the media connection.

### 5. Shut down your Wi-Fi network when not at home.

Whenever you leave home, make sure that the Wi-Fi network is turned off. It is better to unplug your device from connection because, without a network connection, cyberpunks can’t steal your data.

  

-   Open Settings and select Wi-Fi.
    
-   Click the turn-off option to shut down the network connection.
    

### 6. Using Firewalls.

A Firewall acts as a shield in the process of separating your device from the Internet. Some openings called ports may communicate with your device. At this point, the firewall arrests those ports and prevents your device from hackers.

  

You can also use other security software like antivirus programs. In the view of the business sector, Hardware firewalls are appreciable. Software firewalls are widely used for home users since they are cheap.

### 7. Locate the router in the center of your home.

  

The signal from the router radiates in all directions. So placing the router in the center of the room provides more security.

  

However, if you place the router near the window, the signal may also move outside. So the possibility of tracing your signal is high. You may also keep the router in a cardboard box or the antennas covered by foil to prevent these issues.

### 8. Enable MAC Address filtering.

Console router of every device will contain a technique called ‘MAC Filtering or MAC addresses filtering.’ Every connected device has a MAC address, and the identifier of the network card is unique.

  

-   Go to the router’s setting and select MAC filtering, which is found in Wireless security options.
    
-   Save the changes.
    

  

You can also access this through Advanced network filters. You can <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.oit.uci.edu/mobile/registration/find-your-mac-address/">find your MAC Address here</a>.

  

### 9. Disable Remote Administration.

The router’s console can be accessed only when the devices are connected to the network. A standard router provides you remote access. To prevent your device from hackers:

  

-   Disable the remote administration.
    
-   Open your router’s web interface and select Remote administration.
    
-   Select the disable option.
    

  

### 10. Keep your devices healthy.

  

Viruses and malware may infect many devices because they are connected to the public network. Always check the files before transferring them to the computer since they may also contain a virus.

  

To maintain the system with firewalls and anti-malware software. Always keep the software updated. Make sure that the portable devices are safe.

  

Many hackers are using different methods like [ransomware](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/with-ransomware-on-the-rise-how-safe-is-your-business/) and identity theft. To avoid all these issues, you can make some changes by practicing these tips.
