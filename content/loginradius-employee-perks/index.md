This is _Hitesh Kumawat_. I am a BTech-backed Product Designer with a knack for finding elegant solutions to complex UI problems and creating intuitive experiences through front-end development. 

[LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/company/) has been an integral part of my personal and professional growth, especially in the last four years of my employment here. The organization is an excellent combination of professionalism and fun.


## Working at LoginRadius, I’m Exposed to an Amazing Work Culture.

A great work culture can be key to the success of a company. Not only does it promote productivity, but it makes everyday tasks easier. 

**LoginRadius understands that a positive, healthy work culture is a top priority for employees.**

Naturally, every employee is encouraged to be a part of a community of driven and ambitious individuals. This is what makes LoginRadius a place where I can be myself. It’s great to work for a company that makes people feel valued.

Speaking of my manager, he is a leader who leads by example with a warm, “good ol’ country boy' charm. He is equally as passionate as he is compassionate. He believes in creating a positive work environment that fosters professional growth and a refined skill set from his team members.


## LoginRadius Supported My Mental and Economic Well-Being During COVID-19.

It makes me feel good that I am working for an organization that is willing to fight for its employees during hard times. COVID-19 was extraordinarily exhausting for most people and LoginRadius left no stones unturned to look after our mental and economic health during the deadly first and second waves. It organized vitality sessions with medical professionals to provide counseling and education so we could take care of ourselves and our family amid this troublesome period.

Even in today's global financial uncertainty and the state of the job market, LoginRadius is one of the rare companies that has always valued its employees. While most companies are cutting costs and laying off employees, LoginRadius ensured job retention by keeping our paychecks steady.


## LoginRadius Recently Introduced A Revised 11-Month Appraisal Program.

The time period between appraisals is important to employees; it allows them to benchmark their progress and plan long-term goals. By introducing an 11-month appraisal program, LoginRadius has demonstrated that the company truly cares about its employees.

I am one of the first employees to receive this revised appraisal benefit, and I am utterly satisfied. It feels great and boosts motivation and performance. 

**Also, the additional percentage reward for the number of years spent at LoginRadius is the icing on the cake.**

Yes, our association is highly valued, recognized, and respected in every step of our journey at LoginRadius. 


## A Bunch of Other Perks

From yoga and happy hours to on-campus meals and lunch reimbursements, LoginRadius values our health and happiness as much as it does our professional development.

One of the best things about a LoginRadius retreat is that team-building games bring together employees from different teams, so they get a chance to meet people from other departments and spend some really fun time with them. It helps to strengthen our relationships and increase productivity at work after the retreat.
