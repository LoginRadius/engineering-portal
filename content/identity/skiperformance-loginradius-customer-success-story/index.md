## Travel and Tourism

While digital transformation is a clear business impressive, the process of making this vision a reality is often less clear. There are a number of critical building blocks involved, but perhaps one of the most key is digital identity. Heightening security and improving the user experience, it sits at the foundation of digital success. 

This is particularly true within the travel and tourism industries, where traveller confidence has been shaken in recent years by the health crisis.   


## The Situation

Our client, Skiperformance, is a big name within European ski tourism. For more than 15 years, the company - which has offices in Italy and Norway - has helped ski resorts and travelers plan ski adventures around the world. 

While business was thriving, Skiperformance recognized an opportunity to improve its customer experience. The company sought an identity management solution to deliver users with secure, seamless and confidence-inspiring user experiences. 

Skiperformance CTO and co-founder Christian Tomassetti turned to LoginRadius with his requirements. 


## The Challenges

The CEO’s  ambition was to enable seamless customer experiences for travelers using the Skiperformance platform during trip planning. 

As well as simplifying the e-platform’s registration experience through features such as social login, he wanted to make customer management easier, too. 

The team wanted to extend the usability of the LoginRadius platform by introducing registration and social login features to travelers registering and authenticating via the Skiperformance website. 

Importantly, Skiperformance needed a CIAM platform capable of addressing associated aspects like privacy violations with precision.

 

Discussions helped Christian and his team learn how LoginRadius cloud-based customer identity management  works and how it could satisfy all of their key requirements, including:  



* seamless registration
* hassle-free [social authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/social-login/)
* streamlined customer management
* amazing customer experiences

Skiperformance has achieved impressive results since that decision, including: 



* 600,000 more registered users - a 40% increase.
