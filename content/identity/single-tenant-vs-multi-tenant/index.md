Tenancy in [cloud computing](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/01/identity-management-in-cloud-computing/) refers to the sharing of computing resources in a private or public environment that is isolated from other users and kept secret. Tenancy in SaaS is divided into two types: single-tenant SaaS and multi-tenant SaaS.


## What is a Single-Tenant Architecture

A single-tenant cloud runs on a dedicated infrastructure. This means that the hardware, storage, and network are dedicated to a single client, and there are no neighbors to share hosted resources with. They may reside in a dedicated offsite data center or with a managed private cloud provider. 

In a single-tenancy architecture, each tenant gets their own database. This way, data from each tenant remains separated from the other. Furthermore, the architecture is built such that only one software instance per SaaS server is allowed. 


### Advantages single-tenant cloud 



*   **Enhanced security** - Single-tenancy offers true data isolation that contributes to optimal protection and increased security. 
*   **Migration**- When a tenant wants to migrate from a single-tenant (SaaS) system into a self-hosted or local environment, they can quickly move an application to their own managed servers. 
*   **Customization**- Single tenancy offers the ability to architect an environment exactly how a consumer needs it. 
*   **Reliability**- Single tenancy offers consistency and the highest level of performance for an application.


### Drawbacks of single-tenant cloud 



*   **Cost**: Because, single-tenant does not allow cost-sharing for facilities such as deployment and monitoring, companies end up paying more. Also, more customizations and maintenance often take more resources and time, which results in higher costs.
*   **Maintenance**: Since a single-tenant architecture needs continuous modifications and improvements, a lot of maintenance is required. 
*   **Setup**: There may be delays due to individual installs, and not to forget the learning curves, that should be considered as well. 


## What is a Multi-Tenant Architecture 

Multi-tenant cloud architecture is a single cloud infrastructure built to serve multiple businesses. The entire system may cover multiple servers and data centers, incorporated into a single database. 

Cloud providers offer multi-tenancy as a gateway to share the same application with multiple businesses, on the same hardware, in the same operating environment, and with the same storage mechanism. 


### Advantages of multi-tenant architecture



*   **Scalable**: It is very easy to [onboard users](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/01/user-onboarding-revamp-application/) with a multi-tenant cloud. In fact, there is no difference between onboarding ten users from a thousand companies or a thousand users from one company.
*   **Saves money**: Multi-tenancy allows resources to be consolidated and allocated efficiently, thereby saving a lot of expenses. 
*   **Flexible**: A multi-tenant cloud can allocate a pool of resources to the users who need it, as their needs scale up and down.
*   **Efficient**: Multitenancy reduces the need to manage infrastructure and handle updates.

### Drawbacks of multi-tenant cloud 



*   **Security**: Cybercriminals can take advantage of multiple access points to exploit [systems vulnerabilities](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/01/7-web-app-sec-threats/). 
*   **Backup and restoration**: A lot of companies fail to keep up with the latest system backup advances and restore options. 
*   **Limited management**: They do not provide a lot of customization options, and that reduces the consumer's ability to interact with the system.
