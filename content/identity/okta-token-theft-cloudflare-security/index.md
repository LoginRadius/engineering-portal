## Introduction

Recently, Cloudflare revealed a security breach involving its internal Atlassian server, which is suspected to be orchestrated by a 'nation-state attacker.' The intrusion granted unauthorized access to Cloudflare's Confluence wiki, Bitbucket source code management system, and Jira bug database.

According to Cloudflare's CEO Matthew Prince, CTO John Graham-Cumming, and CISO Grant Bourzikas, the breach occurred in mid-November, with the attackers establishing persistent access to the Atlassian server and attempting to infiltrate Cloudflare's infrastructure in São Paulo, Brazil. 

The assailants exploited stolen credentials from a prior breach linked to Okta, a breach that Cloudflare failed to address promptly.

## Cloudflare’s Immediate Action After Breach Detection

[Sources](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloudflare-hacked-using-auth-tokens-stolen-in-okta-attack/) revealed that upon detecting the breach, Cloudflare swiftly took action, revoking the hacker's access and initiating a comprehensive investigation. Remediation measures included rotating production credentials, securing test and staging systems, and conducting forensic analysis on thousands of systems across its global network.

According to sources, despite the breach, Cloudflare assures its customers that their data and systems remain unaffected. However, the company remains vigilant, continuing efforts to bolster software security and manage vulnerabilities.

Cloudflare suspects the attack aimed to gather insights into its network architecture and security protocols, which is indicative of a broader espionage motive. This incident follows a previous breach in October 2023, where Cloudflare's Okta instance was compromised, underscoring the persistent threat landscape faced by the company.

Cloudflare remains committed to fortifying its defenses, exemplified by its thwarted phishing attack in August 2022, demonstrating the efficacy of robust security measures like FIDO2-compliant security keys.
