Did you know adding social login to your website can drastically enhance engagement and bump-up registrations?

If you’re a business with an online platform that has a significant amount of traffic but unable to generate a good amount of leads, you probably need to rework your website’s authentication process.

Yes, nobody wishes to squander their precious time when it comes to registrations on a website. Or we can say, no one wants to juggle separate passwords and ids for different platforms.

Social login enables users to use existing login credentials from a social networking platform including Facebook, Google, Twitter, and more enabling simplified logins and registrations.

Let’s learn how LoginRadius’ social authentication helps to scale business growth and how to implement social login.


## Why Social Login?

While social login bypasses the conventional registration forms that eventually eat up a lot of time, it also builds credibility on an online service provider that is not asking for your details in a single go.

Moreover, another hurdle for businesses seeking business growth through online platforms is the overall security of user data while the information is being collected, stored, and retrieved.

One needs to follow the necessary compliances while collecting PII to ensure that the data is securely collected and managed.

Apart from this, maintaining compliance with enhanced user experience is yet another uphill battle for businesses, especially when all it takes is a couple of seconds to decide whether you have a lead or an increase in the bounce rate of the site.


Here’s the place where you need a smart and efficient social login in place.

LoginRadius’ social authentication not only offers compliance to international privacy and data security regulations but eventually provides a smooth login experience.

Users can quickly sign up for a platform in just a couple of seconds through LoginRadius’ social authentication solution.
