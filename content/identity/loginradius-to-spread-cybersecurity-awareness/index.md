**Let’s join hands to make the internet a safer place for everyone!**

This October, at LoginRadius, we pledge to spread awareness about [National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM)](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month) through awareness campaigns to help individuals stay safe online. 

Initially started by the department of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Cyber Security Alliance, NCSAM has grown into a global initiative supported by many countries. 

Various organizations and governments across the globe join hands in educating people regarding good cybersecurity hygiene and ensuring everybody is safe while using the internet.

Since the global cybersecurity threat vector has increased exponentially, governments are encouraging people to take accountability and focus more on improving their data security and privacy online. 

This year’s theme is “See Yourself in Cyber,” which means every individual or business, no matter in whatever role, must take basic steps to protect their privacy and other data online. 

Moreover, vendors and suppliers must also take ownership of their roles and protect their reputations by incorporating stringent security mechanisms. 


## List of LoginRadius’ Cybersecurity Activities to Support this Year’s Campaign

**Social Media Awareness:** We’ll ensure to keep our clients and followers updated regarding the latest threat vectors and how to stay safe online through a series of insightful and engaging posts.
