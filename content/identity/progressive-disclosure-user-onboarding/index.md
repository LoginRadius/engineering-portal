The ever-expanding competitive business landscape demands enterprises to deliver rich consumer experiences from the moment they interact with the brand for the first time. 

This means if an organization fails to impress the visitor in the first place, they’ll surely lose a potential customer since competitors in every field are just a few clicks away. 

Progressive disclosure plays a crucial role in [enhancing the onboarding experience](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/importance-customer-onboarding/) as it defers rarely used or advanced features for secondary screens that help make applications easier to learn. 

In the context of the onboarding process for a product, it refers to disclosing features or options as the user gradually navigates through the overall process. 

Progressive disclosure helps businesses portray essential information initially and then gradually uncover the rest of the features that ensure users aren’t overburdened and that their purpose is solved. 

Let’s understand what progressive disclosure is, why businesses strictly need to put their best foot forward to adopt progressive disclosure, and how LoginRadius helps pave the path for a successful onboarding process. 


## What is Progressive Disclosure

Progressive disclosure is an innovative interaction design pattern that sequences information and various actions across different screens. 

The purpose is to enhance conversion rates by ensuring users don’t switch to competitors just because they aren’t getting relevant information when they first interact with a brand. 

In a nutshell, progressive disclosure interaction design pattern provides a quick overview of features/content of an application that helps users make better decisions. 


## Benefits and Examples of Progressive Disclosure

With technology offering new horizons to businesses, modern applications and websites are becoming more complex. The more features and functionality we add to our business website/application, the more its interface becomes complex. 

Excessive information/choices eventually make users feel dissatisfied as it hampers their first experience with the product. 

Here’s where progressive disclosure comes into play.

Users always choose the most effortless path to get a job done. They won’t spend an extra second to scroll through and find what they’re actually looking for. 

If a business website/application isn’t able to convince them that they have landed at the right spot within the first interaction of a user, they’ll end up losing a potential client. 

Progressive disclosure helps build a seamless experience for users while portraying the necessary information regarding the features and capabilities of a product that helps [build trust in a user](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-security/) in the initial yet crucial few seconds of their interaction. 

In other words, progressive disclosure streamlines baseline experience as it hides details from users until they need or ask to see them. 

Let’s understand this thing through a real-life example. 

An e-Commerce website contains thousands of products. For these thousands of products, there can be thousands of customers or even more. 

It becomes technically impossible for the vendor to mention all the products on the website’s landing page to please every user that lands on their website. The e-Commerce store places mega menus (drop-down menus) that contain specific categories of products to overcome this. This arrangement saves more space for essential elements, including the search bar and promotional offer banners. 

This arrangement helps everyone, including the buyers and sellers, as users can quickly navigate to their desired product category, choose their product, and make a purchase. 



## Progressive Disclosure Coupled with Progressive Profiling 

We’ve learned a lot about progressive disclosure and have a fair idea about its importance and implementation.

Let’s now look at one of the essential elements that combine with progressive disclosure to help improve customer onboarding and enhance conversions. 


## What is Progressive Profiling? 

**Progressive Profiling** is an intelligent feature that gradually gathers data from customers in an automated way. 

Progressive profiling for customer registration allows you to split a potentially complicated registration process into multiple steps. You can capture a customer’s information upfront and then slowly build out a holistic view of that customer through subsequent actions.

The benefit of progressive profiling is that it requests permissions for a customer’s data at various stages of their life cycle rather than all at once. 

You can establish a greater level of trust with your customers as you only request their personal data when needed and not just every time they interact with your brand. 

LoginRadius’ progressive profiling helps businesses seamlessly enhance conversion rates through a rich consumer onboarding experience. 


## Progressive Disclosure + Progressive Profiling = Great Onboarding + Increased Conversions

Progressive disclosure and progressive profiling both alone can help improve customer onboarding, but when you combine them in a single application, the results are marvelous. 

Over the years, business giants are leveraging both components in designing rich consumer experiences that improve first interaction with the brand and eventually ensure that the user enters the sales funnel and becomes a customer. 

With LoginRadius’ Progressive Profiling, you can continually build richer profiles as you earn customers’ trust.

The smart feature allows you to collect first-party data from your customers gradually, allowing you to build trust before you ask for too much personally identifiable information. 

With many people now wary of the ever-growing list of companies that have fallen prey to data breaches, customers are more reluctant to hand over too much sensitive information. 

[LoginRadius’ Progressive Profiling](https://www.loginradius.com/progressive-profiling/) module allows you to decide what information you collect on each visit so you can increase your conversion rate and build customer profiles over time.


## Final Thoughts 

Progressive disclosure is an inevitable element for a successful consumer onboarding process that leads to conversion. 

However, leveraging the advancements of Progressive Profiling makes things work flawlessly and paces the conversion rates as users enjoy interacting with brands and sharing insights. 

LoginRadius’ Progressive profiling is helping thousands of businesses to streamline their onboarding process to enhance conversion rates.
