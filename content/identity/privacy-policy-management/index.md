Businesses are accountable to consumers that trust them with their personal data. So, they should not only be protecting it but also should be explaining how they are managing and processing such data. 

Our recently launched Privacy Policy Management serves as the central place where businesses maintain versions of their privacy policy, notify consumers when it changes, or get their acceptance of the newer versions.
