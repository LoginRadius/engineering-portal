## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses must keep pace with the latest technology to remain competitive. 

One way to do this is through re-platforming or migrating from an outdated platform to a newer one, often in the cloud. In this blog post, we'll dive into re-platforming, how it works, the differences between re-platforming and rehosting, the risks involved, and some examples of successful re-platforming efforts. Additionally, we'll explore why re-platforming your identity solution is essential and how cloud re-platforming can benefit businesses.

## What Is Replatforming?

Replatforming is moving a business's digital operations from an older, outdated platform to a newer one. The objective is to improve performance, [increase scalability](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/handling-scalability-security-loginradius/), enhance security, and reduce costs. This can involve a range of technologies, including operating systems, databases, middleware, and applications.

## Why Replatforming is Important?

Replatforming is a critical process that organizations undertake to keep their IT infrastructure aligned with the latest advancements in technology. In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses must be agile and adaptable to remain competitive. 

Legacy systems often become outdated, lacking the scalability, security, and efficiency required to meet modern business needs.

By replatforming, companies can leverage the benefits of newer platforms and technologies. This includes improved performance, enhanced security measures, and the ability to integrate with other systems seamlessly. 

Replatforming also provides an opportunity to optimize workflows, streamline processes, and deliver a better user experience.

Furthermore, replatforming enables organizations to future-proof their IT infrastructure. By migrating to a more flexible and scalable platform, businesses can easily adapt to changing market dynamics, scale their operations, and incorporate new features and functionalities as required. It allows businesses to stay relevant and meet the evolving demands of their customers.

## How Replatforming Works?

Replatforming involves analyzing existing systems to determine the best path forward, including assessing the current architecture, identifying gaps and areas for improvement, and evaluating potential new platforms. 

Once a suitable new platform has been identified, the data and applications are migrated to the new environment, often through automated tools and processes. Finally, the new platform is tested and rolled out to users.

## Replatforming Vs. Rehosting

Replatforming is often confused with rehosting and refactoring. Rehosting involves moving applications and data from one physical environment to another without making any significant changes to the underlying code. 

Replatforming, on the other hand, involves moving applications and data to a new platform while making necessary modifications to improve performance, scalability, security, and other factors.

## Replatforming Vs Refactoring

When considering modernizing their IT infrastructure, organizations often face a choice between replatforming and refactoring. While both approaches aim to improve system performance and align with modern technology, they differ in their execution and outcomes.

Replatforming involves migrating an application or system to a new platform while preserving its core functionality. This approach minimizes risks and disruption, as the existing system's functionality remains intact. 

Replatforming is often chosen when the current platform is outdated, lacks support, or hampers scalability and performance. It offers a faster time to market, cost-efficiency, and the ability to leverage new platform features.

On the other hand, refactoring involves rewriting or restructuring the existing codebase to improve its design, scalability, and maintainability. This approach requires a more significant investment of time and resources but offers the opportunity to optimize the system thoroughly. 

Refactoring is typically chosen when the existing codebase is poorly structured, hard to maintain, or when new functionalities need to be added seamlessly. It allows for greater control and customization but may involve higher risks and longer development cycles.

Ultimately, the choice between replatforming and refactoring depends on the specific requirements, resources, and objectives of the organization.

## What Are the Risks involved in Replatforming?

Replatforming involves significant risks, including potential [data loss](https://www.loginradius.com/security/), application downtime, and compatibility issues with existing systems. 

In addition, there is a risk of disruption to business operations during the migration, impacting revenue and customer satisfaction. To mitigate these risks, careful planning and execution are essential, including thorough testing and contingency planning.

## Replatforming Examples

Several high-profile examples of successful re-platforming efforts include Netflix, which migrated from its legacy data center infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Capital One, which relocated from its legacy mainframe systems to the cloud. 

These efforts have enabled these companies to achieve greater scalability, agility, and cost-effectiveness while improving performance and security.

## Why Replatform Your Identity Solution?

Identity and access management (IAM) solutions are critical to maintaining security and compliance in modern IT environments. However, legacy IAM solutions can be costly, difficult to maintain, and prone to security vulnerabilities. 

Replatforming IAM solutions to cloud-based platforms can provide numerous benefits, including enhanced security, greater scalability, and [lower costs](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/ciam-minimizes-expenses-access-management/).

Hence, it’s always a great idea to switch to a robust customer IAM like LoginRadius that can help scale your business growth, enhance security, and meet all the compliances.

## Customization and Integration of Cloud Replatform

One of the significant advantages of cloud replatforming is the ability to customize and integrate various services seamlessly. Cloud platforms provide a wide range of services and features that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an organization.

Customization involves adapting the cloud platform to align with the unique requirements of the business. This can include configuring security settings, optimizing performance, and tailoring the user interface to match the company's branding and workflows. By customizing the cloud platform, organizations can create a more personalized and efficient environment that aligns with their business goals.

Integration is another critical aspect of cloud replatforming. Organizations often have existing systems and applications that need to work cohesively with the cloud platform. Cloud platforms offer robust integration capabilities, allowing businesses to connect and streamline their workflows across multiple systems. 

This integration can involve data synchronization, API integration, or even leveraging pre-built connectors to popular third-party services. By integrating various systems, businesses can achieve data consistency, automate processes, and improve overall operational efficiency.

In summary, customization and integration are key components of cloud replatforming, enabling organizations to tailor the cloud platform to their specific needs and seamlessly connect with existing systems. This flexibility and connectivity empower businesses to leverage the full potential of the cloud and enhance their overall productivity and competitiveness.

## How Can the LoginRadius CIAM Platform be Your Go-To Solution?

### 1. Quick and easy deployment

It can take months to build or install your solution on-premises. And doing so takes time and resources from your engineering team, which will speed up identity functionality and best practices. LoginRadius can be deployed on any cloud (AWS, Azure, Google, or Alibaba Cloud) in mere days. Millions of customer identities can be migrated with no interruption in service.

### 2. Reliability

LoginRadius’ [Single-tenant architecture](https://www.loginradius.com/private-cloud/) is typically more reliable since one software instance serves one client. So the entire system remains unaffected by other cloud traffic and peak load performance. Also, it becomes easier to scale as compared to the multi-tenant. Moreover, one can configure In-transit Network Routing in single-tenancy.

### 3. Hassle-free migration

It is easier to migrate data from LoginRadius’ single-tenant architecture since the data store contains data from a single customer. One does not need to worry about mixing customer data or using complicated migration scripts.
