## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses must keep pace with the latest technology to remain competitive. 

One way to do this is through re-platforming or migrating from an outdated platform to a newer one, often in the cloud. In this blog post, we'll dive into re-platforming, how it works, the differences between re-platforming and rehosting, the risks involved, and some examples of successful re-platforming efforts. Additionally, we'll explore why re-platforming your identity solution is essential and how cloud re-platforming can benefit businesses.

## What Is Replatforming?

Replatforming is moving a business's digital operations from an older, outdated platform to a newer one. The objective is to improve performance, [increase scalability](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/handling-scalability-security-loginradius/), enhance security, and reduce costs. This can involve a range of technologies, including operating systems, databases, middleware, and applications.

## How Replatforming Works?

Replatforming involves analyzing existing systems to determine the best path forward, including assessing the current architecture, identifying gaps and areas for improvement, and evaluating potential new platforms. 

Once a suitable new platform has been identified, the data and applications are migrated to the new environment, often through automated tools and processes. Finally, the new platform is tested and rolled out to users.

## Replatforming Vs. Rehosting

Replatforming is often confused with rehosting and refactoring. Rehosting involves moving applications and data from one physical environment to another without making any significant changes to the underlying code. 

Replatforming, on the other hand, involves moving applications and data to a new platform while making necessary modifications to improve performance, scalability, security, and other factors.

## What Are the Risks involved in Replatforming?

Replatforming involves significant risks, including potential [data loss](https://www.loginradius.com/security/), application downtime, and compatibility issues with existing systems. 

In addition, there is a risk of disruption to business operations during the migration, impacting revenue and customer satisfaction. To mitigate these risks, careful planning and execution are essential, including thorough testing and contingency planning.

## Replatforming Examples

Several high-profile examples of successful re-platforming efforts include Netflix, which migrated from its legacy data center infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Capital One, which relocated from its legacy mainframe systems to the cloud. 

These efforts have enabled these companies to achieve greater scalability, agility, and cost-effectiveness while improving performance and security.

## Why Replatform Your Identity Solution?

Identity and access management (IAM) solutions are critical to maintaining security and compliance in modern IT environments. However, legacy IAM solutions can be costly, difficult to maintain, and prone to security vulnerabilities. 

Replatforming IAM solutions to cloud-based platforms can provide numerous benefits, including enhanced security, greater scalability, and [lower costs](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/ciam-minimizes-expenses-access-management/).

Hence, it’s always a great idea to switch to a robust customer IAM like LoginRadius that can help scale your business growth, enhance security, and meet all the compliances.

## How Can the LoginRadius CIAM Platform be Your Go-To Solution?

### 1. Quick and easy deployment

It can take months to build or install your solution on-premises. And doing so takes time and resources from your engineering team, which will speed up identity functionality and best practices. LoginRadius can be deployed on any cloud (AWS, Azure, Google, or Alibaba Cloud) in mere days. Millions of customer identities can be migrated with no interruption in service.

### 2. Reliability

LoginRadius’ [Single-tenant architecture](https://www.loginradius.com/private-cloud/) is typically more reliable since one software instance serves one client. So the entire system remains unaffected by other cloud traffic and peak load performance. Also, it becomes easier to scale as compared to the multi-tenant. Moreover, one can configure In-transit Network Routing in single-tenancy.

### 3. Hassle-free migration

It is easier to migrate data from LoginRadius’ single-tenant architecture since the data store contains data from a single customer. One does not need to worry about mixing customer data or using complicated migration scripts.

### 4. Easy personalization

In the case of SaaS, mainly the services are thoroughly managed by the service provider’s team. However, the service provider can give dedicated server access to customers in the case of single-tenant—for instance, server logs access to customers. The same level of ownership or customization cannot be provided for multi-tenant customers.

## To Conclude

Replatforming can be a daunting but essential process for businesses to remain competitive in today's digital world. Replatforming involves careful planning and execution to minimize disruption and mitigate risks. 

Cloud re-platforming can provide numerous benefits, including enhanced scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and security. Replatforming your identity solution can help improve safety and compliance while reducing costs. 

By leveraging LoginRadius CIAM, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and thrive in the fast-paced digital landscape while planning to re-platform.
