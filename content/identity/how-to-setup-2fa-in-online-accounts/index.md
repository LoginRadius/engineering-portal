## Introduction

How to set up 2FA on your accounts? And why is it important in the first place? As social media is becoming increasingly popular, security is becoming something of supreme importance. 

Even though choosing a [strong password](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/2021/01/how-to-choose-a-secure-password/) helps you in certain ways, by adopting 2FA, you can improve and enhance security further. So, let's know more about this extra layer of protection and how to set up 2FA on your accounts. 

First stop. 

## **What is Two-Factor Authentication?**

2FA is one of the best security methods that use two layers to verify a consumer's identity. This means, rather than simply entering the password to log into an account, two-factor authentication requires a code to be sent via text message to the consumer's phone number or generated through an app.

This type of verification code helps and ensures that only the authorized consumer can access their account. Similarly, [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/2019/06/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) offers two or more authentication layers to approve account access for consumers. 

## Types of 2FA Methods

SMS Verification is one of the most common forms of 2FA. It involves sending a one-time code via text message to the user's registered phone number. While widely accessible and requiring no internet connection, it is vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks and relies on the reliability of the cellular network.

Authenticator Apps, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and Authy, generate time-based codes for authentication. These apps provide offline functionality, making them useful in areas with no network coverage. They are also less susceptible to phishing attacks compared to SMS. However, they require installation and setup on a smartphone, and there is a risk of losing access if the device is lost or reset.

Hardware Tokens, like YubiKey or RSA SecurID, are physical devices that generate codes for authentication. They offer a high level of security since they are not connected to the internet, providing protection against phishing attacks. However, they can be costly to implement for individuals, and there is a risk of losing the hardware token.

Biometric Authentication uses features like fingerprint, face, or iris scans for verification. It offers convenience and a high level of security. However, it requires compatible devices and there is a risk of compromising biometric data.

Backup Codes are pre-generated codes used as a backup when the primary 2FA method is unavailable. They provide access in emergencies but are limited in use and must be securely stored to prevent unauthorized access.

## **What are Authenticator Apps?**

Authenticator apps are meant to be installed on your smartphones to obtain passcodes to sign in to your accounts. They are intended to be more secure than texting; they provide[ flexibility if you are traveling to a place where there is no mobile service](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/2018/12/use-multi-factor-authentication-dont-cell-phone-access/).

Some of the options include [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en), [Microsoft Authenticator Authy](https://authy.com/guides/microsoft/), or HDE OTP. 

All these apps follow the same procedure - when you are adding a new user account, you need to scan a QR code associated with the account, and it is saved in the app. 

The next time you sign in to your app or service, it will ask for a numerical code. You need to open up the authenticator app and check the randomly generated authentication code to access your account securely.

## **How to Set up 2FA on Your Social Media Accounts?**

![how-to-set-up-2fa-on-your-social-media-accounts](how-to-set-up-2fa-on-your-social-media-accounts.png)

A lot of applications offer 2FA currently, especially if you are storing important and sensitive data, financial information, emails, social media, files, contact details, etc. 

2FA needs more than one factor to login. This might include parameters like "something you are," for example, biometrics in the form of iris scan or fingerprints, "something you know," a password, and "something you have," like a smartphone or hardware key. 

Find out how to set up 2FA on your accounts: 

### 1. Google

If you want to set up an authenticator on the Google account, first you need to download the Google Authenticator app available on the Play Store. Once downloaded, do the following:


*   Go to Gmail and click the profile icon.

## **Why is 2FA important?**

As cybercriminals are getting smarter, 2FA has become more mandatory than ever. Without it, you might end up leaving your [accounts vulnerable to hackers](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/2020/12/login-security/) for sealing your personal information, hacking your online credit card details, and accessing your bank account. By adding the additional step to your account, you get the edge to prevent hackers from accessing your account. 

## Common 2FA Mistakes to Avoid

Using SMS as the Sole Method is a common mistake, as SMS codes are vulnerable to interception through SIM swapping attacks. It is advised to use authenticator apps or hardware tokens for added security.

Not Storing Backup Codes Securely renders them useless if lost or compromised. It is crucial to store backup codes in a secure location, such as a password manager or a locked safe.

Using Predictable Codes is another mistake, as codes generated by apps can be predictable if not set up correctly. It is important to ensure apps are configured for random, time-based codes rather than sequential ones.

Ignoring Biometric 2FA Options is a missed opportunity for added security. Biometric methods offer high security but may not be utilized if available on devices.

Sharing 2FA Codes undermines the purpose of 2FA. Users should be educated not to share codes with anyone, including family and friends, to maintain security.

## Comparison of Popular Authenticator Apps

Google Authenticator is known for its simple setup with QR codes and offline functionality. However, it lacks backup or sync options and does not support multi-device use.

Microsoft Authenticator supports both Microsoft accounts and third-party apps. It offers cloud backup for easy recovery. However, it requires a Microsoft account and may not be as straightforward for non-Microsoft services.

Authy provides multi-device support and offers cloud backup and sync for easy recovery. However, it requires an account for backup, and some users prefer fully offline solutions.

HDE OTP (One-Time Password) is secure and easy-to-use, working offline for added convenience. However, it is less widely adopted than other options and offers limited additional features.

YubiKey, a Hardware Token, boasts high-security standards and does not rely on mobile devices. However, it can be costly for individual users and poses a risk of being lost or damaged.

Users can consider these factors when choosing the most suitable authenticator app based on their needs for security, convenience, and compatibility with various services.
