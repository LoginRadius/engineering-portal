In a world where every user demands a personalized experience, businesses without personalization would surely miss out on business opportunities. 

However, customizing a user identity system is a whole different concept and isn’t just limited to adding a personalized greeting for a user with their name. 

Customizing experiences right from the beginning when the user interacts with a brand impacts conversions and overall lead generation. 

Whether collecting user information, displaying the most relevant results, or suggesting products based on their previous preferences, customization is undoubtedly pivotal in improving conversions, sales, and lead generation. 

This post will highlight customized identity systems and learn how it paves the path for increased business advancements. 


## What is an Identity System? 

Before we inch towards the business benefits of customizing an identity system, let’s first understand what an identity system is. 

An identity system or identity management system is an information system or a group of technologies working together to ensure the right individual has access to the right resources. 

Moreover, an identity system or a [consumer identity and access management](https://www.loginradius.com/) (CIAM) system helps businesses secure millions of consumer identities on their platform to offer a robust mechanism that prevents data breach. 

 

A CIAM solution also offers valuable insights into a consumer’s behavior, which further allows businesses to tailor their marketing and onboarding strategies.

## Role of Identity System Customization

Since we have a fair knowledge of identity systems, let’s understand how customization can be a game-changer for achieving business goals through an identity system. 

We all come across different personalization experiences whenever we purchase goods from online marketplaces. 

Whether it’s Amazon suggesting a pair of running shoes when you purchase sports shorts or Netflix suggesting you a series based on your preferences, personalization is undeniably the key to push consumers to the sales funnel. 

However, the actual game begins in the first couple of seconds whenever an individual interacts with a brand for the first time. 

Yes, enterprises need to understand the importance of the onboarding process, which, if personalized adequately, can do wonders for their brand. 

Let’s understand this thing with an example.

Imagine a user lands on a website and thinks about signing up. The website asks for a long list of details for the signup procedure. 

The user somehow manages to fill the enormous signup form (although around 80% of users will switch at this moment). 

Now the website, after the signup process, again asks for specific information. This information would be used to deliver a personalized experience but would undoubtedly hamper the user experience. 

The remaining users would now switch platforms. 

Here’s where an identity management solution like LoginRadius comes into play.
