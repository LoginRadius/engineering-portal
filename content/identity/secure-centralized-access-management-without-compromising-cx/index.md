## Introduction

Centralized access management is swiftly becoming the need of the hour as we adopt a fully digital lifestyle that demands robust security at every touchpoint. 

We are surrounded by several applications and devices that simplify our daily lives and eventually become integral to our modern lifestyles. 

And we’re always on a hunt for better experiences that impact our lives through several connected devices and apps working flawlessly to help streamline various aspects of our daily routine. 

However, when we see things through the lens of an information security professional, security could be the least prioritized thing while embarking on a [digital transformation journey](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/customer-experience-driving-digital-transformations/). 

While most platforms offer stringent security measures across their devices or applications, many businesses cannot provide a seamless user experience and security when a user switches from one app to another or device to another. 

A little glitch in the overall experience or security threat while accessing services from one device to another or a bad cross-platform experience could lead to a situation where businesses lose consumer trust. 

So, what could be the ideal way to enhance centralized access security without compromising user experience? Let’s figure it out. 


### 1. Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO)  is a method of authentication that allows websites to use other trustworthy sites to verify users. Single sign-on enables users to log in to any independent application with a single ID and password.

SSO is an essential feature of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform for controlling access. Verifying user identity is essential when it comes to knowing which permissions a user will have. The [LoginRadius Identity platform](https://www.loginradius.com/) is one example of managing access that combines user identity management solutions with SSO solutions.

Enhanced user experience is one of the most valuable benefits of SSO. As repeated logins are no longer required, customers can enjoy a modern digital experience. The benefits for enterprises include increased customer loyalty and higher conversion rates.

Hence, SSO is undeniably the perfect solution to improve centralized access between devices or applications without compromising security and user experience since users can jump from one app to another without friction. 

Apart from this, cross-platform integration and authentication are other reasons businesses must put their best foot forward in adopting a single sign-on solution for their platforms. 


### 2. Go Passwordless

When it comes to secure and streamlined authentication, nothing beats a passwordless authentication mechanism. 

[Passwordless login](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-passwordless-login/) verifies consumer identities without using passwords or any other memorized credentials.

The consumer is confirmed with the help of a possession factor, which can be an object that uniquely identifies the user with an email (link) or SMS (OTP) sent to the registered email address or phone number, respectively.

Once the link or OTP is verified, the consumer will be logged into the account.

More and more businesses are now leveraging the true potential of going passwordless since it minimizes authentication friction, and users can quickly authenticate in a number of devices or applications hence improving centralized access. 


### 3. Federated Single Sign-On (SSO)

[Federated single sign-on](https://www.loginradius.com/federated-sso/) (SSO) establishes inter-organizational trust that helps seamless authorization and authentication of each others’ users.

Fed SSO generates an authentication URL, and when the user clicks on the URL, the cloud identity service makes a digitally signed token to verify the partner platform. And this token is further submitted by the web browser to the partner’s SSO during a new session.

The federated SSO works by offering a partnership role involving two parties, including the service provider (SP) and identity provider (IdP). The identity provider provides a digital token, and the service provider validates the digital token and creates a new session offering access to the program/application.

With federated SSO, businesses can overcome the hassle of resetting passwords and ensure their customers can flawlessly switch between applications/platforms of different service providers without worrying about their security.

Businesses requiring higher peak load management and an identity management system to provide real-time load management should choose a reliable CIAM solution offering federated SSO capabilities.

In a nutshell, fed SSO bridges the centralized access and authentication gap between multiple platforms and enables users with cloud identity services to access services offered by one or more partner businesses/media without needing a separate login at the partner platform.


## In Conclusion 

Robust authentication security coupled with a great user experience is what it takes to build long-lasting customer relationships. And businesses that aren’t offering seamless centralized access would surely lag behind their competitors. 

With secure centralized access through single sign-on and passwordless login, businesses can quickly win customer trust and stand ahead of their competitors.
