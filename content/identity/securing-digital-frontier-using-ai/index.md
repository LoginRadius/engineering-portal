## Introduction

Gone are the days of writing down passwords in a notebook. Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the world with a blaze to make a difference in every industry, including [Customer Identity and Access Management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/) (CIAM).

CIAM improves security and customer retention in the long term. Simply put, it combines customer identification methods and personalization to optimize the customer experience.

If we take a look at the alarming [healthcare breach statistics](https://resources.freeagentcrm.com/healthcare-data-breach-statistics/), it is clear that cybersecurity is a crucial aspect of many industries.

But we can improve security with the help of artificial intelligence and keep customer data protected in the long term. Moreover, CIAM platforms utilize AI power to give customers a personalized experience.

## The Role of AI in Customer Identity and Access Management

We’ve all heard of the new AI models taking over industries to make a difference for good. You can now leverage artificial intelligence’s advanced analytics to help your customers and employees. Some of the main roles of AI in CIAM include:

* Personalization
* Fraud detection
* Security
* Advanced analytics
* Customer support (Chatbots)

For example, security experts can receive actual data on potential threats and act accordingly to mitigate the risks, thanks to AI.

Having an assistant with limitless capabilities to keep your business safe on [Black Friday and Cyber Monday](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/10-black-friday-cyber-monday-tips-for-businesses/) is a real-time example of AI’s importance. It can scan through all transactions and flag suspicious activity within minutes. 

There’s much more to discover about AI’s capabilities and even more to come in the future.

## Leveraging AI for Secure Authentication

We’ve mentioned a few use cases of AI in security, but how can you take advantage of its full potential? 

### 1. Risk-Based Analytics

You can start by following the behavioral analytics for risk-based authentication. This will help you find fraudulent or suspicious activities to ensure you never miss a fraud attempt, even if it’s unsuccessful.

### 2. Biometric Authentication

Next, you can implement biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to make it easier and more secure for customers to log in.

### 3. Penetration Testing

Most importantly, you must monitor real-time threat detection and use [security testing tools](https://pentest-tools.com/alltools) to mitigate cybersecurity risk. Penetration testing involves finding vulnerabilities within a system. This is an excellent way to see first-hand what security measures to implement.

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication

Last but not least, the popular [multi-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-factor-authentication/) (MFA) is an essential security layer to protect your customer data and prevent unauthorized access. Users must enter a one-time password or a verification code from their email or phone every time they log in from an unrecognized device.

## Personalizing the User Experience With AI

The best part is that CIAM platforms utilize AI to provide advanced analytics for personalized customer experience. The AI keeps track of all previous interactions and purchases to offer customized product recommendations.

Any type of business can use AI to improve customer experience. However, implementing [CIAM for D2C businesses](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/d2c-brands-utilize-ciam-for-growth/) to record and manage many customer identities, along with all the other features, is essential.

You can set up tailored marketing campaigns to send personalized customer ads according to their behavior and preferences. AI can learn about every customer and send them exactly what they want. Therefore, you will increase customer loyalty and engagement in the long term.

If a person has searched for X product, the predictive analytics will send personalized ads and forecast possible next moves. You can set the AI to offer personal discounts if they haven't purchased and encourage loyalty further.

Everything we’ve mentioned above, combined with a lightning-fast AI chatbot, is a recipe for the best customer experience. However, don’t forget about human customer support – there are limits to chatbot capabilities.

## AI-Driven Compliance and Privacy Controls

You must abide by laws, and nothing is better than an AI compliance checker. Once you set it up and enforce proper privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, you can let the CIAM platform check and allow users to control their privacy settings.

But can excellent[ customer experience and security co-exist](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/security-ux-can-coexist/) in the same environment?

Of course! Artificial intelligence can help you protect your data, notice suspicious activity, and alert administrators. You can also receive alerts for suspicious login attempts and unusual patterns.

The same AI can handle personalized ads and recommendations while offering special discounts to unsure users.

## Omnichannel Support

Embrace the seamless multi-channel customer experience with CIAM platforms. They allow users to access their accounts through different devices and continue from where they left off.

Whether your customers use desktops, laptops, mobile phones, or tablets, they’ll receive the same personalized ads and a familiar experience. Moreover, their data will be synchronized and merged into their account data.

Customer identity and access management platforms allow users to authenticate once on different devices and recognize them, also known as centralized authentication and authorization.

## CIAM vs. IAM

The main difference between [CIAM and IAM](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/iam-vs-ciam/) is the user base. CIAM manages the identities of your external customers and partners. IAM platforms manage your internal users – employees, contractors, and partners. 

You can have a CIAM platform for your customers and an IAM platform for your personnel.

The CIAM platforms help your customers receive a pleasant browsing experience with personalized ads, discounts, and extra security. On the other hand, IAM platforms focus on security layers for your employees to prevent fraud attacks and data breaches.

## Conclusion

The next generation of customer identity and access management is at your doorstep, waiting for you to embrace its full potential. Artificial intelligence is already being implemented in every aspect of our daily lives. So why not take advantage of it before your competition?

Adding extra layers like multi-factor authentication and real-time protection can greatly enhance your security. Administrators can receive alerts for any suspicious activities to prevent data breaches and fraud attacks before they even happen.

In the meantime, your customers will receive quick responses from the chatbots and be able to log in through multiple sources, including Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, and more.

The use of AI in CIAM will continue to evolve, providing limitless capabilities to keep businesses safe and thriving in the future.
