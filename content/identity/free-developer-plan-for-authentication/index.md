## Empowering the entire developer community with Enterprise-grade CIAM platform

We built the authentication solution we always wanted as developers: powerful enough for enterprise needs, but accessible to everyone. LoginRadius' Free Forever Developer Plan puts professional CIAM capabilities in your hands with zero financial barriers.

Most "free" authentication plans trap you with limited featuresâ€”just enough to get you started, but forcing you to upgrade when you need anything substantial, then charge you a fortune. We took a different approach. Our Free Forever plan gives you complete authentication capabilities, including passwordless, passkey, unlimited social login, and B2B multi-tenancyâ€”all with no hidden costs or artificial limitations.

You can check out our free forever plan [here](https://www.loginradius.com/pricing). 

In this blog, we will walk you through whatâ€™s included in our Free Forever plan, how it benefits your business, and why LoginRadius is the go-to choice for developers.

## Breaking the Authentication Barrier

We believe that authentication should be accessible from day oneâ€”whether you're launching a passion project or a startup to serve multiple businesses. That's why we've designed a truly Free Forever plan. No hidden fees. No expiring trials. Just powerful, developer-friendly authentication without the usual roadblocks.

"Security shouldn't be a luxury that only enterprise companies can afford," says Rakesh Soni, Founder & CEO of LoginRadius. "With our Free Forever Developer Plan, we're putting professional-grade authentication tools in the hands of every developer, because we believe that protecting user identities should be the foundation of any digital product, not an afterthought."

## Free Forever: Because Authentication Shouldn't Be a Bottleneck for Innovation

Weâ€™ve always believed that developers should be able to integrate authentication without unnecessary frictionâ€”without sales calls, complex onboarding, or paywalls.

Thatâ€™s why our Free Forever plan isnâ€™t just a feature-focused free tier. We have designed it as a fully functional authentication solution that grows with your application. Developers get to build, test, and take their apps to production without speaking to anyone at LoginRadius (unless they want to ðŸ˜‰).

## How Do We Compare to Other Platforms?

Not all free plans are built the same. While many CIAM providers offer free tiers, they often come with missing features. For instance, Auth0 provides authentication services too, but when you look closer, LoginRadius Free Forever offers more flexibility, better multi-tenancy support, and key authentication methods that their platform lacks.

Hereâ€™s how we compare:

* **Stronger B2B Multi-Tenancy Support**: We provide 10 Monthly Active Organizations (MAOs), while Auth0 only includes 5, giving you more flexibility when building SaaS applications.
