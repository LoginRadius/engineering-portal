## Introduction

Data compliance is swiftly becoming the need of the hour for businesses thinking to step ahead of the competition. However, building the future of data compliance requires stringent [data privacy and security policies](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/consumer-data-privacy-security/) and best practices. 

We live in a digital-first era where data is the fuel to keep businesses up and running. But the way brands use this data makes all the difference. 

Unlike the conventional times when brands used to collect heaps of customer data without their consent, organizations must first build trust in clients before expecting even a bit of detail. 

Customers are already interacting with brands like Google, Amazon, and Apple, so they know what a great user experience is. Also, they’re aware of their privacy rights since global data and privacy regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. 

So, if a business isn’t building trust in potential clients by offering reliable data security and privacy, it would lag behind its competitors. 

Let’s look at some aspects that can help organizations stay ahead of the curve by leveraging digital privacy for compliance management. 


## What is Data Compliance? Why Must Businesses Adhere to Data Compliance?

Data compliance could be defined as identifying the applicable governance for customer/user data security, protection, management, storage, etc., and helps establish strategies with protocols to ensure data is secure from unauthorized access and usage. 

In a nutshell, data compliance law states how organizations (regardless of their industry) meet regulatory and legal requirements for collecting, processing, and maintaining personal information.

A breach in data privacy can lead to legal consequences and may be followed by investigations and fines. 

But why do organizations need to immediately think about invoking the [true potential of data compliance](https://www.loginradius.com/compliances/) and privacy? 

Well, consumers or employees can respond with civil lawsuits whenever their privacy is compromised while an organization collects and processes personal information.

Apart from this, data and privacy compliance laws and regulations help protect consumers in different countries by ensuring data is handled appropriately.


## Why is Data/Privacy Compliance Crucial Today?

One of the biggest reasons organizations must comply with privacy regulations is to avoid heavy fines. The ones that don’t implement the privacy regulations could be fined up to millions of dollars and face penalties for years.

Due to increased regulations, including the EU’s GDPR and the United States’ CCPA, that protects unauthorized access to crucial data, privacy compliance is now crucial for every business.  

Also, the increased number of cybersecurity threats pertaining to customers’ crucial information has impacted businesses; businesses must incorporate a robust security mechanism for better protection.
