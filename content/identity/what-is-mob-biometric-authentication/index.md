Gone are the days when you could simply rely upon your user credentials – username and password – to secure your account. With the increasing number and complexity of cyberattacks, companies need to innovate and develop newer forms of securing their user devices and accounts. As an example, mobile phone users are now accustomed to using alternative modes of authentication like gestures and screen lock patterns – that are gradually replacing passwords.

As the number of smartphone users keeps increasing, biometric solutions are gaining more popularity as they add to the overall user experience and are less intrusive than entering passwords.

What is mobile biometric authentication – and what are its common use cases? Let us discuss that in the following sections.

## What Is Mobile Biometric Authentication

In simple terms, [mobile biometric authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/biometric-authentication-mobile-apps/) is a form of authentication that uses biometrics to detect and authenticate the identity of the user trying to access a mobile app. It can be performed using multiple ways including fingerprint readers, facial recognition, voice recognition, and more.

These biometric tools can either be an addition – or a replacement – for the traditional username-password method. 

How is **biometrics in mobile devices** enabled? Most of the latest smartphones – using Apple, Android, and Microsoft technologies – are now fitted with advanced digital sensors such as touch screens, cameras, fingerprint scanners, and microphones that are facilitating [user authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/).

Why is mobile biometric authentication gaining widespread popularity? Here are some reasons:

*   Biometrics allows devices to use your physical attributes – fingerprints, face, voice, or even iris color – to authenticate your identity. This adds to your overall online experience, in place of passwords that are hard to remember.

*   Biometrics can also be used as part of the [multi-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-factor-authentication/) (MFA) process – especially when signing into sensitive or confidential accounts.

Next, let us look at a few use cases of biometric authentication in mobile phones.

## Biometric Authentication for Mobile Devices

### Native vs. In-App Biometrics

* **Native Biometrics:**

    * Utilizes built-in hardware sensors on the device such as fingerprint readers, facial recognition cameras, and voice recognition microphones.
    
    * Offers seamless integration with the device's operating system for quick and secure authentication.

* **In-App Biometrics**:

    * Requires developers to implement biometric authentication within the app using software development kits (SDKs).

    * Provides more flexibility in customization and additional security layers specific to the app's requirements.

## Multimodal Biometric Authentication

* **Combining Biometric Modalities**:

    * Enhances security by using multiple biometric identifiers such as fingerprint and facial recognition together.

    * Provides increased accuracy and reduces the risk of false positives or negatives.

## Benefits of Biometric Authentication for Mobile Devices

### 1. Enhanced Security

    * Replaces traditional passwords with unique biometric identifiers, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

    * Protects sensitive data and transactions with a personalized authentication method.

### 2. Improved User Experience

    * Offers a convenient and user-friendly way to access mobile apps without the need to remember complex passwords.

    * Speeds up the authentication process, saving users time and effort.

### 3. Reduced Fraud and Identity Theft

    * Mitigates the risk of fraudulent activities as biometric features are difficult to replicate or forge.

    * Prevents unauthorized access even if a device is lost or stolen.

## Best Practices for Biometric Authentication on Mobile Devices

1. Secure Storage of Biometric Data:

    * Ensure biometric data is securely stored on the device's secure enclave or trusted execution environment.

    * Avoid transmitting biometric data over insecure networks to prevent interception.

2. Regular Updates and Patches

    * Keep the biometric authentication system updated with the latest security patches and firmware updates.

    * Address any vulnerabilities promptly to maintain the 
    integrity of the authentication process.

3. User Consent and Privacy Protection

    * Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and using their biometric data.

    * Implement transparent privacy policies regarding the storage and usage of biometric information.

4. Testing and Validation

    * Conduct thorough testing of the biometric authentication system to ensure accuracy and reliability.

    * Validate the system's performance across diverse user demographics and environmental conditions.

5. Fallback Authentication Methods

    * Provide alternative authentication methods (e.g., PIN or password) as backup options in case of biometric authentication failure.
    
    * Enable users to reset or re-enroll biometric data if needed for troubleshooting purposes.

## Mobile Biometric Authentication – Use Cases

Mobile biometric authentication is being used in a variety of applications across industries. Here are a few use cases:

*   **Mobile banking**

Biometric security is among the major challenges for banks and fintech companies. They are using biometrics to authenticate transactions being performed using mobile banking. Additionally, banks are using biometric authentication to validate banking customers when they try to access their mobile banking app or bank accounts. For instance, [HSBC Bank](https://www.hsbc.co.in/ways-to-bank/mobile-banking/india-app/) has introduced the fingerprint and touch method for its customers to sign into their mobile banking app.

Some financial institutions are also considering biometric authentication – as a replacement for PINs or passwords and even digital signatures.

*   **Online retail**

Another popular use case – particularly for facial recognition – is in online or eCommerce retail. Online shoppers often abandon their shopping cart or their purchases when they forget their passwords or the normal sign-in procedure is too time-consuming. Facial biometrics can resolve this problem for online shoppers and increase retail business.

For instance, Mastercard has introduced its [Identity Check Mobile](https://developer.mastercard.com/product/identity-check-mobile#:~:text=Mastercard%20Identity%20Check%20Mobile%20is,or%20security%20question(s).) – the mobile-based biometric authentication solution. Using this mobile app, online shoppers can verify their identity by capturing and sending their selfies to the online retailer's website.

*   **Healthcare**

The use of biometrics also has widespread application in the field of healthcare. Biometric information – obtained through fingerprint and iris scanning, and facial recognition can enable hospitals to identify patients and retrieve their medical history. This ensures that healthcare facilities can provide the right treatment by having access to the correct information.

As an example, New York-based [Northwell Health](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2019/12/biometrics-healthcare-how-it-keeps-patients-and-data-safe-perfcon) is using iris scanning and face recognition technology to identify patients in emergency situations – thus preventing any patient fraud or wrong prescriptions.
