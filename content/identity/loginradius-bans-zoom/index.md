LoginRadius has banned the use of the video-conferencing app Zoom by LoginRadius staff owing to the security concerns centering around fake end-to-end-encryption claims and incomplete privacy policy.

The decision came after the wide-scale criticism about its security and privacy lapses surfaced in recent weeks. There were also instances of leaked passwords and conferences being hijacked midway.

## Why Is the Ban Imposed

Zoom shot to unexpected popularity amid the coronavirus pandemic. With countries adopting quarantine measures, more and more people were using the platform for virtual meetings, online education, and even face-timing with friends.

However, the video conferencing app came under the scanner when the news of multiple security vulnerabilities began surfacing from around the world.

Earlier in April, [Taiwan advised government agencies](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52200507) against using Zoom when a group of researchers discovered that some traffic on the con-call was being sent through Beijing when all the participants were in North America.

Google, SpaceX, NASA has also reportedly banned the application over data security concerns. [Singapore has banned its teachers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/singapore-bans-teachers-using-zoom-after-hackers-post-obscene-images-on-screens) from using Zoom after gatecrashers interrupted a class and posted obscene images. Even the [FBI has warned](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-of-teleconferencing-and-online-classroom-hijacking-during-covid-19-pandemic) of Zoom’s hijacking threats.

The Cyber Coordination Centre (CyCord) of India’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has also issued a [16-page advisory](http://164.100.117.97/WriteReadData/userfiles/comprehensive-advisory-Zoom-%20meeting%20platfom-20200412-%282%29.pdf) related to its security loopholes and poor data privacy practices.

## Putting Security at the Core

LoginRadius has been implementing its business continuity plan to [fight the COVID-19 outbreak](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2020/03/loginradius-business-continuity-covid-19-outbreak/). We are following stringent privacy regulations and taking every possible measure to protect the confidentiality of our customer data.

Therefore, as several countries expressed concern about the flawed security policies of the Zoom app, we decided to pull the plug on this one immediately.
