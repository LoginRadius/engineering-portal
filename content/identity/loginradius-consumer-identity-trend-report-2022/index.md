## Introduction

We are thrilled to announce the release of our annual industry report, **Consumer Digital Identity Trend Report 2022**.

We surveyed over 500 brands and 1.17 billion users worldwide from the LoginRadius Identity Platform to provide an in-depth analysis of the consumer data market, including changes in consumer behavior over time and their projected impact on business practices and IT requirements.


## Evolution is Essential for a Great Consumer Experience 

The next few years will be a pivotal time for the digital consumer identity space. One critical aspect covered in this report is that consumers are evolving from the traditional registration model to a more personalized, easy to authenticate model that's secure. Keeping up is a challenge – and it requires businesses to adjust their identity management systems.

The report findings highlight that if your business wants to stand out in a highly competitive world, you’ll need to make a huge improvement in your interactions with your customers. This means not just your interactions with them but also theirs with your brand, starting from registration to checkout.

Businesses can achieve this by tailoring authentication and login methods to their customers' preferences, such as passwordless login or multi-factor authentication via email or SMS, or social sign-on.
