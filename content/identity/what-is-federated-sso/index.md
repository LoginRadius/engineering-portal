## Introduction 

In a world where digital experiences play a crucial role in the overall success of a business, federated SSO (single sign-on) helps brands deliver seamless authentication experiences across multiple platforms.  

With fed SSO, businesses can bridge the authentication gap between multiple platforms and enable users with cloud identity services to access services offered by one or more partner businesses/media without needing a separate login at the partner platform. 

[Authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-authentication/) plays an essential role in the overall success of a business both from an information security perspective and a user experience perspective. 

Hence, neglecting its worth could cause brands to lose their potential clients, and their loyal customers may also switch. 

Let’s understand the aspects of fed SSO and how businesses could leverage it to deliver the highest level of user experience reinforced by security. 

But first: SSO!

[Single sign-on](https://www.loginradius.com/single-sign-on/) provides a unified login experience to users that wish to switch platforms/applications of the same vendor. In a nutshell, SSO ensures smooth authentication and minimizes fatigue while users switch between different applications/media of the same vendor.                                                                                                    

SSO is practiced within an organization to ensure users access inter-connected platforms without needing to re-enter credentials or re-authenticate themselves. 


## What is Fed SSO? How Does it Impact Businesses? 

Federated single sign-on (SSO) establishes inter-organizational trust that helps seamless authorization and authentication of each others’ users. 

Fed SSO generates an authentication URL, and when the user clicks on the URL, the cloud identity service makes a digitally signed token to verify the partner platform. And this token is further submitted by the web browser to the partner’s SSO during a new session. 

The federated SSO works by offering a partnership role involving two parties, including the service provider (SP) and identity provider (IdP). The identity provider provides a digital token, and the service provider validates the digital token and creates a new session offering access to the program/application. 


## Who Needs Federated SSO? 

Businesses concerned regarding their brand reputation in delivering a rich consumer experience without compromising security shouldn’t ignore the true potential of federated SSO. 

With federated SSO, businesses can overcome the hassle of resetting passwords and ensure their customers can flawlessly switch between applications/platforms of different service providers without worrying about their security. 

Apart from this, businesses requiring higher peak load management and an identity management system to provide real-time load management should choose a reliable CIAM solution offering federated SSO capabilities.
