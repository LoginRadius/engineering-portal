## Introduction

Cloud computing is changing how industries operate in diverse sectors. In fact, according to [cloud-shift research](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-09-gartner-says-more-than-half-of-enterprise-it-spending), around 65.9% of spending on application software will directed toward cloud technologies by 2025. 

Amidst this shift from legacy systems to scalable cloud platforms, securing the user's identity and data is one of the formidable challenges that businesses have to face. A [2023 report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) mentions that attackers frequently target cloud environments, and around 39% of the breaches span multiple instances with an average cost of USD 4.75 million. 

Organizations are investing heavily in protecting and securing their cloud infrastructure, and this initiates the requirement for a cloud identity platform. 

## What is a Cloud Identity Platform?

[Cloud identity](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-cloud-identity-and-its-benefits/) platform serves as the bedrock of a robust security framework for cloud solutions. It is a comprehensively integrated centralized platform that manages user identities, authentication, authorization, and other security-based aspects in a cloud-based environment. 

Let's break it down. Imagine you are developing an application. To make it work smoothly, you need a framework that recognizes users and grants specific permissions within the app. You can either build this identity layer from scratch, including all the authentication hoops like logins, password resets, and multi-factor setups. It's a time-consuming journey.

Or, you can plug into a cloud identity platform that offers all the security essentials neatly packed on a centralized platform. This platform creates a robust and flexible framework for managing identities, enhancing security and user experience, and establishing authoritative control in the cloud. 

## Key Features of the LoginRadius Cloud Identity Platform 

[LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/) supports a robust set of capabilities for managing users and implementing seamless authentication and authorization practices on both cloud and on-premise platforms. Let’s understand the key features: 

### 1. User Authentication

The LoginRadius Identity Platform offers a complete range of customer authentication methods, such as email and phone numbers, and popular third-party identity providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others. Besides, it also offers multi-factor and [risk-based authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/risk-based-authentication/) for added security.

### 2. User Management 

LoginRadius provides a centralized system for managing and adding profiles to the cloud platform. It offers different functionalities like account creation, deletion, retrieval, and updation. 

### 3. Identity Federation

With the [identity federation](https://www.loginradius.com/federated-sso/), users can easily sign in to the application using their existential credentials from third-party identity providers. It supports SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for quick integration with enterprise identity solutions. 

### 4. Customizable Authentication Flows

With LoginRadius, it becomes easy to customize the authentication and registration flows to match your business application needs. With the availability of SDKs and APIs, businesses can swiftly integrate authentication services into their web and mobile applications.

### 5. Security and Compliance 

The cloud identity platform is built on a secure infrastructure, meaning it complies with all the major [global government regulations](https://www.loginradius.com/compliances/) like the CCPA and the GDPR.

### 6. Scalability 

With 100% uptime and 35 data centers across the globe, LoginRadius can scale to 100s of millions of users in a couple of seconds. It grows at the same pace as your business and customer base. 

## Why Use LoginRadius For Your Custom User Management?

If you are wondering why you should use an identity platform like LoginRadius if you are building your custom user management application, then one of the aspects is simplifying [user authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/). With the ability to securely authenticate a user, you can easily enforce a password policy, ensure the safe storage of passwords, implement MFA, and link multiple accounts, or not use passwords at all. 

In the past, developing an in-house identity framework made more sense when organizations primarily focused on managing the identities of internal employees. However, in today's landscape, where companies aim to enhance customer experience and gather more comprehensive customer data, implementing a customer identity solution has become more complex.

If managing identity and access isn't a core aspect of your business operations, creating your own customer identity program can become more complicated and expensive. That’s where a cloud identity platform can help. 

## Wrapping up

Cloud identity platforms can make implementing a secure and reliable identity layer in applications easy. The role also extends beyond conventional security measures. These platforms become instrumental in seamlessly implementing a secure and reliable identity layer within applications, simplifying complex processes, and mitigating potential risks.
