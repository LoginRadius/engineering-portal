There is a constant need for compliance and security in every industry that uses customer identities for tracking records, transactions, or any other activity. As such the advantages of audit trails are multidimensional - from generating historical reports, crime investigation, future budget planning, audit compliance, risk management, and many more.

The LoginRadius’ recently announced Consumer Audit Trail detects threats in real-time, manages incident response, and if need be, even performs a forensic investigation on past security incidents. It also turns log entries, and events from security systems, into actionable information.

Additionally, it prepares audits for compliance purposes, provides the functionality to track user engagement, and gain an in-depth understanding of customer behavioral metrics.

## Intent Behind the Launch

The ability to track back records to their source comes with a lot of benefits. Transparency, compliance, accountability, and security of sensitive information are a few of them.

Through real-time monitoring, businesses can automate audit logs and use them to identify unusual activities or operational issues. 

In addition, audit logs can be used to gain deeper insights into an identity cloud environment. This information improves the application's performance and maintainability and automates actions that otherwise require manual intervention.

## A Final Word

The world that we live in today falls under several regulatory laws - be it [the EU's GDPR, California's CCPA](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/09/ccpa-vs-gdpr-the-compliance-war/), or any other international statutes. It is a good practice to maintain a reliable and accurate audit log and trail system.

The LoginRadius' Consumer AuditTrail feature plays a vital role in the maintenance, security, availability, and integrity of the records so businesses can understand the [bigger picture in the cybersecurity threat](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2020/05/cyber-threats-business-risk-covid-19/) landscape.
