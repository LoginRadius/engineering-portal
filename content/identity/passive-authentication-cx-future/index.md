## Introduction

As digital technologies have proliferated, so has the need to keep customers happy and secure. Companies have been innovating ways to satisfy their customers and stay ahead of their competitors by providing an experience their customers can't find elsewhere. Now, customers have become more thoughtful, and their expectations have increased exponentially. 

Today's customer holds power. And as the customer continues to demand more, companies must meet that demand. The internet has changed everything, and customers expect immediate access to information and products. They want their shopping experience to be seamless, their delivery times to be lightning-fast, and their payment options to be convenient. 

Passive authentication is one-way companies respond to this need for speed and convenience by making [authentication seamless](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/) and automatic without sacrificing security.


## The Absolute Necessity Of Passive Authentication

Customer experience is no trivial pursuit. It's an ocean of data and information you must contend with in your attempts to surface the "right" customer at the "right" time. 

Today's sophisticated customers expect, even demand, a superior experience that begins as soon as they get on your website but extends through micro-moments throughout their entire lifecycle. To deliver this kind of experience, authentication, fraud protection, and personalization need to be seamless within their everyday digital activities.

Passive authentication is the newest wave of customer experience, and it's set to revolutionize the way you interact with each other online. It enables people to quickly and easily authenticate themselves online with public and private sector organizations. It is a convenient way to identify yourself with businesses or government entities without filling out forms or entering passwords and to prove who you are so that you can access services and benefits more quickly than ever before. It relies on observing the user's behavior to determine if they are who they claim to be without requiring any additional work from the user.

Passive authentication is frictionless; it lets users get on with their day without taking extra steps or making different decisions that might slow them down or cause frustration.

## Active Authentication vs. Passive Authentication: What's The Difference?

Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of a person or device, such as a computer, mobile phone, or tablet. It's the most basic level of security, and it can be used for everything from logging into your bank account to unlocking your smartphone. 

Most of us are familiar with active authentication, which asks you to do something, like follow a dot on your smartphone screen or read something aloud. It's an effective way to prove who you are, but it can be cumbersome and can take time and effort. Passive authentication is much simpler; all you have to do is look at a camera, and you are in. 

It is the next wave of customer experience and has a lot to offer. From [biometric authentication](https://blog.loginradius.com/identity/what-is-mob-biometric-authentication/) to voice recognition and facial recognition, passive authentication can be as simple as looking at your phone.

Making the shift from active to passive can be a delicate process. But when it's done right, the benefits are immense.


## The Future of Truly Secure Biometrics is Passive

Biometrics is now around for a long time, but they have only recently begun to enter the mainstream. Customers are finding ways to make lives easier and more convenient, which is why passive authentication can help provide them with peace of mind during online transactions. 

The most common form of biometric authentication is fingerprint scanning, which many people on their smartphones use to unlock their devices or pay for things online. This new wave of customer experience is an opportunity for companies to improve their ROI by focusing on passive authentication.


## In Conclusion

In the end, it can be seen that passive authentication has spread over the years, and its implementation continues to grow. As more organizations implement this protocol, it will become an even more significant part of the customer experience. So, pulling all the pieces together, we see that passive authentication offers a lot of potential to organizations when it comes to establishing their customer experience.
