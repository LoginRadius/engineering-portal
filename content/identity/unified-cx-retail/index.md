In an increasingly digital world, brands know they depend on a unified experience. However, this is only possible when **consumer experience in retail** focuses on designing and orchestrating a single insight, ensuring consumers receive the exact value repeatedly across all touchpoints, products, and services. It is the diversity of these experiences that determines the quality of consumer relationships.


## What is Unified Consumer Experience?

Unified consumer experience can be defined as consumers' perceptions (conscious and subconscious) of their relationship with the brand during the entire life cycle.

The American research and consulting company [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/customer-experience-strategy), in its definition, explains quite well what unified experience is about, "The practice of designing and reacting to consumer interactions to meet or exceed their expectations and thus increase their satisfaction, loyalty, and promotion."

Moreover, it's about getting to know consumers so completely that you can create and deliver personalized experiences that attract them to stay loyal to the brand or company and "promote" it to other people. That's the most valuable advertising tactic that exists.

With the execution of any plan, some challenges may cross your way. The same goes for creating a unified consumer experience in retail. You have to be prepared for the upcoming difficulties that may lead to some problems in one way or another. Therefore, you must identify those challenges to be prepared for them. The following can help.


### Create consistent brand experiences across all channels

 While consumers may be willing to accept different service levels across different channels, they expect the brand value proposition to remain consistent. But the proliferation of channels makes it difficult to ensure consistency across all of them.


### Integration of brand and channel experiences

An integrated channel experience is highly desirable but challenging to achieve. Technology inherited processes and organizational territorialism can be barriers to integration.


### Consolidate consumer data in a single view

 Having a [single view of the consumer](https://www.loginradius.com/profile-management/) across interactions, channels, products, and time would facilitate coordinated, unified communications with the consumer.

## Benefits of Unified Consumer Experience

The objective is clearâ€”to guarantee consistency of responses across all contact channels. A unified consumer relationship strategy must be based on multi-channel interaction management designed around a centralized knowledge base.

With that in mind, here are the top five benefits of investing in a unified experience.


### Improve word of mouth marketing

One of the biggest benefits of having a unified experience is delighting the consumer, who will certainly spread their satisfaction with family, friends, and colleagues. Word of mouth marketing is by far the best way to boost your results.


### Improve consumer engagement

A satisfied consumer will engage with the brand more often and will certainly become a loyal consumer. In the age of social media, it's easier to share information online. Suppose a consumer decides to buy something while running through your feed. In that case, a unified experience will ensure they have the same shopping experience throughout their journey, no matter where they are.
