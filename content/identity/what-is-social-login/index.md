## Introduction
  
Social login, also termed as social sign-in or social sign-on, allows your consumers to login and register with a single click on a website or mobile application using their existing accounts from various social providers. It simplifies the sign-in and [registration experiences](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/), providing a convenient alternative method to create an account where it is mandatory.

-   For consumers, social login is a single-click login method for accessing the website and mobile application—one that there is no need for excess credentials and allows consumers to skip traditional registration methods.
    
-   Social login is an attractive feature for developers and businesses that can help streamline consumer verification while also providing more reliable data access for personalization.

## How Does Social Login Work?

Social login is a quick and convenient way for users to log into websites using their existing social media accounts. Instead of creating a new account on the website, users can simply click a button to sign in with their Facebook, Google, or other social media account.

When a user clicks on the social login button, the website will redirect the user to the chosen social media platform's login page. After the user logs in, the social media platform sends back the user's data to the website. This data can include the user's name, email address, profile picture, and any other information the user has authorized the website to access.

## How Do Popular Social Login Platforms Compare?

Some of the most popular social login platforms include Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Microsoft. Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Facebook is the most popular social login platform, with over 2 billion active users worldwide. It provides a wide range of user data, including the user's name, email address, profile picture, and interests.

Google is also a popular social login platform, with over 1 billion active users. It provides similar data to Facebook, but also allows users to log in with their Google+ account.

For detailed information about the login preferences, you can [download](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/consumer-digital-identity-trend-report-2022) our **Consumer Digital Identity Trend Report 2022.**

Twitter is popular among younger users, but it provides less user data than Facebook or Google. LinkedIn is popular among professionals, and it provides more detailed professional information about the user.

## Why Should Businesses Use Social Login?

Social login and registration provide benefits in various ways:

-   Log in via a third-party web page or Facebook or Google accounts can be done with just a few clicks on the button. This is a much faster way to access the sites and mobile applications than filling out the complete registration form as in traditional login.
    
-   Social login reduces the effort to remember passwords, which means people don’t need to create and keep track of more credentials, lessening password fatigue and login failure.
