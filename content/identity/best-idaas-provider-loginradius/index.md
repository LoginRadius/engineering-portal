Identity-as-a-service or IDaaS refers to cloud-based identity and access management solutions that are offered on a subscription basis. At its core, IDaaS delivers access, intelligence, and identity governance capabilities to consumers' systems.

Interestingly, IdaaS has been experiencing exponential growth in recent years. So, to understand this rapid surge in the best IDaaS providers, let's go back a little.

Consumers have already been exploring and utilizing the online facilities—from transactions, education, work, shopping, entertainment, to medicines—for some time now. They want frictionless, non-invasive, and [seamless solutions](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-experience-solutions/). 

So, how are companies delivering instant, personalized gratification? The basis for most is _identity_.

Consumers want identity solutions to be easy and simple-to-use.

[Data privacy](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2020/06/consumer-data-privacy-security/) is another prerequisite necessity. In fact, a survey by Gemalto finds out that 71% of consumers [choose to opt-out of a company](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/press-release/majority-of-consumers-would-stop-doing-business-with-companies-following-a-data-breach-finds-gemalto) that experienced a data breach. Talk about a dealbreaker!

Likewise, there are also key questions about data privacy, ownership, control, and scalability. Scoring these areas on a firm ground will make a good ID solution. A growing number of companies are already working on this goal. 

The best IDaaS providers are evolving, and new ones are emerging. How do you choose the right one?

## 5 Factors to Consider Before Choosing the Best IDaaS Provider

![Best IDaaS solution](Best-IDaaS-solution-1.png)

**1\. It should connect to mixed platform environments.**

A lot of organizations (especially enterprise-level) still prefer the hybrid approach to host their business applications, i.e. both [on-premises and in the cloud](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-tenant-cloud/). The best IDaaS providers will offer consumers seamless access from a variety of devices, or mostly when legacy solutions are involved. 

It should not matter where the applications are hosted or accessed, the IDaaS solution should simplify integration and create a simplified, smooth, and unified consumer experience. 

**2\. It should deliver better security.**

With a [modern cloud identity platform](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/06/customer-identity-and-access-management/#:~:text=Customer%20identity%20and%20access%20management%20(CIAM)%20is%20a%20digital%20identity,while%20securely%20managing%20customer%20identities.) comes security with modern techniques. Identity theft and network compromise are a big problem that IT managers face today, and the lack of passwords is a major explanation for these breaches.

There should be a large number of security techniques included as the identity management platform transitions to the cloud. Examples include one-way password hashing, salting that secures communication between all vulnerable end-points. 

**3\. It should verify and manage all identities.**

With modern industries requiring robust access and security policies, the best IDaaS provider should include identity management tools for different use cases. 

For example, when new devices, applications, and consumers are introduced, or third-party relationships are integrated, the access requirement and priorities are also changed. Your IDaaS provider should be able to access authorized resources without having to [authenticate and sign in](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/) separately to each application.

Moreover, your IDaaS solutions provider should also include frameworks for single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity with [multi-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/06/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) (MFA) that removes silos and enables uninterrupted network environments.

**4\. It should offer a complete app access lifecycle management.**

When a new user joins your organization or an existing user takes on a different role, your IDaaS solution should make provisioning easier with automatic account creation, role-based authorization management, [single sign-on](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/05/what-is-single-sign-on/), and automated account deprovisioning.

A comprehensive, automated app access lifecycle management eliminates helpdesk calls, reduces IT burden, and saves time. It is also easier to offboard users by instantly removing access and deactivating app accounts.

**5\. It should offer multi-factor authentication (MFA).**

Consumers aren't confined to just the one network, device, or applications today. They have to remember a lot of passwords for different accounts. But then, passwords alone cannot be trusted to keep accounts secure. You need a stronger authentication factor at a granular level and MFA should do the trick.

The best IDaaS provider should include MFA with (at least) the following combination:

- Soft token with one-button authentication.
- One Time Passcode (OTP) sent over text or email.
- User-configurable security question as a second layer.

Also, ensure that your IDaaS provider offers custom configurations, whenever necessary for optimal performance. Make sure it is affordable, flexible, and designed to scale (forecasting your rapid growth).
