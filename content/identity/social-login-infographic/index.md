Social login allows consumers to authenticate with their existing login information from a social network provider like Facebook, or Google. It means the consumer can simply sign into a third party website without having to create a new account for the website. 

Social login simplifies registration and login for consumers. For this primary reason, social login is gaining popularity among ecommerce brands and retailers looking to turn visitors into buying customers. 

By allowing users to register and verify themselves with a simple click through their existing social media profile eliminates the need for long registration forms, and password recovery. 

Infact, 70.69% of 18-25 year-olds prefer social login in the LoginRadius' [Consumer Identity Trend Report 2020](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/digital-identity-trends-2020/). 


## How Does Social Login Work

You don't need to do a lot for work to implement social login. Here's how it works. 

**Step 1:** The consumer chooses the desired social network provider upon entering an application.

**Step 2:** A login request is sent to the social network provider.

**Step 3**: The consumer gets access to the app once the social provider confirms the identity.
