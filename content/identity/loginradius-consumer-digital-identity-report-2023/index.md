## Rich Customer Authentication Experience is Pivotal for More Conversions 

According to our Consumer Identity Trend Report 2023, providing a rich and seamless authentication experience to customers is crucial for [driving conversions](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/authentication-tools-boost-sales/). 

Consumers today expect convenient and secure ways to prove their identity, and businesses that fail to meet these expectations risk losing out on potential sales. 

The report shows that businesses that offer passwordless login or multi-factor authentication via email, SMS, or social login have seen a significant increase in conversions. 

Additionally, implementing these authentication methods can help businesses mitigate the risk of identity theft and fraud. By providing a frictionless authentication experience, businesses can enhance the customer journey, increase customer loyalty, and ultimately drive business growth.
