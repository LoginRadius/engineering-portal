When you respect your consumer's time, they will return the favor with even better involvement on your platform. The benefit of SSO for enterprises runs on a similar concept. 

So, what is SSO, and why does the above statement hold true?

Single Sign-On or SSO is an authentication process that allows consumers to log in to multiple independent applications with a single set of credentials. With SSO, users can access a suite of applications via one single login, irrespective of the platform, technology, or domain used. 

On a similar note, it is also a challenge for both users and IT administrators to secure thousands of accounts and related user data.

For both users and IT administrators, securely handling thousands of accounts and related user data is challenging. Enterprises use single sign-on as a single strategy to improve IT security, improve user experience, and cut IT cost in one go. 


## 7 Advantages of SSO That Every Enterprise Should Know 

No matter what your role as an end-user might be, you probably don’t like memorizing unique credentials for multiple logins, right? For instance, when a customer calls IT about resetting passwords, an enterprise can lose hours, tech resources, and money. 

## **1\. It increases employee and IT productivity.** 

By contrast, a single point of access will reduce wasted time and resources. Here’s how.

With single sign-on, you can: 

- **Reduce support calls**: Users with just one password to access all their apps won't require assistance as often.
- **Improve user experience**: Since there’s no need to hop between multiple login URLs, or reset passwords, users save between 5 to 15 seconds per login. 
- **Mitigate security risks**: Employees can use their SSO login credentials on any device, in any web browser, without risking security.

As you can see, the ability to increase the productivity of end-users is one of the greatest benefits of single sign-on.

## **2\. It improves security capabilities.**

One misconception about using an SSO solution is that it weakens security. The argument rests on the premise that if a master password is stolen, all related accounts will be compromised. 

In theory, this appears to be true, but with common-sense practices, SSO can actually reduce password theft. How?

Since users only need to remember one password for multiple applications, they’re more likely to create a stronger (harder to guess) passphrase, and less likely to write it down. These best practices reduce the risk of password theft. 

As explained in the next section, a single sign-on strategy can also be combined with [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/06/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) for extra security.

## **3\. It combines with Risk-Based Authentication (RBA).** 

Here’s how combining RBA with Single Sign-on provides an extra layer of security. 

As mentioned earlier, SSO gives your customer or end-user one “key” to sign in to multiple web properties, mobile apps, and third-party systems using one single identity. 

For even more security, you can combine SSO with risk-based authentication (RBA). With RBA, you and your security team can monitor user habits. This way, if you see any unusual user behavior, such as the wrong IP, or multiple login failures, you can demand extra identification verification. If the user fails at this, you can block them from access. 

This powerful combination can prevent cybercriminals from stealing data, damaging your site, or draining IT resources. 

## **4\. It reduces password fatigue.**

To prevent cybercrime, security professionals insist on unique passwords for every single application. This means that the average user must remember dozens of passwords for personal and office use. Unfortunately, this often leads to "password fatigue." 

How does password fatigue hurt enterprises? In short, more passwords, more problems. If customers have a hard time signing in, they’ll leave your site or app before you can convert them.

A [recent usability study](https://baymard.com/blog/password-requirements-and-password-reset) by Baymard Institute proves this point. In this study, Baymard tested existing account users at two e-commerce sites (Amazon and ASOS) and found that 18.75% of users abandon their carts due to forgotten passwords or password reset issues.

The benefit of single sign-on is that it’s only one password for customers to remember, for all of your applications.

## **5\. It streamlines the user experience.**

[Enhanced user experience](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-experience-solutions/) is one of the most valuable benefits of SSO. As repeated logins are no longer required, customers can enjoy a modern digital experience. The benefits for enterprises include an increase in customer loyalty and higher conversion rates.

## **6\. It prevents Shadow IT.**

Shadow IT is not new to the world of cybersecurity. It refers to unauthorized [downloads in the workplace](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3239849/shadow-it-its-not-what-you-think.html).

In the past, Shadow IT was limited to employees purchasing software at office supply stores. But as cloud-based downloads become more popular, the potential for risk grows.

To solve this issue, IT admins can leverage SSO to monitor what apps employees use. Thus, identity theft risks can be thwarted. 

Bonus: With a single platform, a company’s IT or compliance team can ensure that global and local compliance rules are being followed, as well.

## **7\. It increases software adoption rates.**

Have you ever given up on a new app because the customer access or sign-up process was a pain? If you have, that’s a “technology fail.”

Technology should make our lives easier, not cause frustration. Making sign-up or login easier with SSO increases the chance that customers will adopt your technology, use your app, and keep returning for more.

To help you achieve this, LoginRadius is 100% committed to providing the latest industry-standard authentication technology. 

If SSO sounds like a good choice for your company, here’s how to get started. 

*   **Web SSO**  is a browser-based session management system that allows consumers to access any connected web properties with a single identity.
*   **Mobile SSO** works the same way as web SSO, except it unifies consumer sessions across multiple connected mobile applications. 
*   **Federated SSO** utilizes IDPs to store and authenticate consumer identities to log in to third-party web portals, mobile applications, and more, depending on their configuration. Several identity protocols like SAML, JWT, OpenID Connect, OAuth, and Multipass are designed to authenticate consumers.
