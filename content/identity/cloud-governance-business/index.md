With cloud computing evolving leaps and bounds, enterprises are exploring new horizons to streamline processes and scale business growth.

Since many businesses are inching towards cloud services, it’s becoming quite challenging for them to provide a governance model that not only provides visibility of every cloud service but eventually offers appropriate access with proper security.

It would be great for businesses to learn about the fact that migrating from on-premises to cloud isn’t a piece of cake and requires an adequate governance model in place.

You might be thinking about what governance model is and why your business requires it implemented within the organization.

Well, just like on-premise IT infrastructure, companies relying on the cloud must have control over which apps or software can be accessed within the organization and by which department.

In the cloud, the same can be implemented in a couple of seconds. To handle the overall efficiency and costs, businesses must have a certain set of rules.

Let’s learn what cloud governance is and reasons to rely on cloud governance solutions for streamlined processes.


## What is Cloud Governance

Cloud governance could be defined as the set of rules and protocols that [enhance data security](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2020/12/data-security-best-practices/) and helps to manage risks to ensure smooth functioning in a cloud environment.

With cloud governance in place, organizations can ensure that all the systems interactions along with access are precisely measured and managed without hampering the overall security.

There are endless complexities whenever a business migrates from on-premise to cloud, which impacts the architecture as well.

Cloud governance streamlines access for users with rules that simplify establishment, verification, and [reinforces policy compliance](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/03/privacy-compliance/).   

Here are the reasons why your business needs cloud governance:

**1. Easy management of cloud resources.**

One of the biggest advantages of cloud governance is the delivery of precise access control coupled with cost management without breaking the first line of defense.

A strong governance strategy allows enterprises to organize multiple accounts and provide access as per their requirement and designation. This not only strengthens data security but also lends a hand in organizing and maintaining resource allocation on the cloud.

**2. Cloud governance minimizes compliance risk.**

It doesn’t matter which industry vertical you serve, you need to conduct regular security and compliance audits and assessments. Cloud governance can help you in preparing a long list of compliances that are under security frameworks.

Most businesses aren’t aware of data and security compliances, which is perhaps the reason they have to pay hefty fines whenever there are any legal consequences.

It’s always a great decision to audit the compliances and implement the required compliances that can ensure data and privacy security for your clients and employees accessing data over the cloud.

**3. Cloud governance reduces costs.**

Gone are the days when you had to deploy a team that can manually track accounts, compliance, and costs. You can now leverage automation to control access, policy, and the overall budget for your specified projects.

Apart from this, the governance solutions can provide enforcement actions that can further allow you to do the follow-ups whenever you receive an alert. This prevents non-compliant activities and saves time and effort as well.

**4. Cloud governance improves security.**

As an organization moves to the cloud, certain risks linked to data storage, maintenance, and retrieval arise. Here’s where cloud governance comes into play.

Enterprises can be sure enough that their data is securely managed and stored in the cloud with certain protocols in place. This reduces the chances of employees and consumers inching towards shadow IT to get the job done as they would already have a solution for every issue.

Organizations that are consistently worried regarding the concept of shadow IT and its consequences for their company can leverage cloud governance to avoid any similar issues.

**5. Cloud governance regulates and monitors data access.**

Another great aspect associated with cloud governance is that enterprises can regulate and monitor data access in real-time. This means if there’s unauthorized access to data stored over the cloud, the same would be reported to the admin in real-time.

This enhances the overall data security and the admin can keep an eye on insignificant data access requests even within the organizational network.


## Conclusion

Cloud governance should be the top-most priority for businesses leveraging [cloud infrastructure](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/02/strategies-secure-cloud-operations/) in today’s era as the data regulations are getting stringent day-by-day.

The aforementioned aspects depict the role of cloud governance and how it lays the foundation of security and data access within an organization.
