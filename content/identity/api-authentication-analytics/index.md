Businesses can't build and manage everything in-house. Many a time, they require third-party experts to help them meet a variety of critical needs. The use of third-party APIs for their applications is a similar requirement. 

In addition, businesses need the right data to address the following questions:



*   How are the third-party APIs performing?
*   What are the API consumption patterns?
*   Are there any useful API Insights that can help in future decisions? 

LoginRadius being a CIAM solution provider, completely understands these requirements and launches Authentication API Analytics for businesses. 

The feature contains useful charts and analytic tools to view and measure an application's overall performance (where using LoginRadius).
