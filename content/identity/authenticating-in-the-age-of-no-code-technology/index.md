## Introduction

Data breach refers to an incident when unauthorized individuals or organizations have access to sensitive information that they don’t own.

No matter how strong your product’s architecture is, if the identification and authentication process is not apt, data breaches will happen. Even the biggest companies in silicon valley are not immune to these attacks.

For instance, in 2021, the personal data of [533M Facebook users](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/03/facebook-data-leak-insider/) were posted on a forum for free. In the same year, data of more than [500M LinkedIn users](https://cybernews.com/news/stolen-data-of-500-million-linkedin-users-being-sold-online-2-million-leaked-as-proof-2/) were discovered on the dark web.

To avoid data breaches you need to ensure that only the right individuals have access to your product and data.

You can do that with the help of identification and authentication technologies.


## What are Identification and Authentication Technologies?

Identification is a process in which an individual produces private information voluntarily that is unique and can be used to recognize them. Private information is also referred to as means of identification. For example, name, date of birth, address, etc.

[Authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-login-authentication/) is a process when the identity of the user is validated and they are given certain permissions or access to a certain data because of that. For instance, when you enter the password into your computer, your identity is validated and you gain access to your system.


## How Do Identification and Authentication Technologies Work?

The process of identification begins with the recognition of parameters that make every user unique. Then, the values of these parameters are collected and stored for every customer and a key is assigned to each of them.

Often, these keys or codes are alphanumeric. They are assigned to every user which is unique and can be used to access other details like the name and email address.

This means that a lot of (or at least enough) identifying information is to be collected from the user and stored safely. As the user is entering those details, steps have to be taken to ensure that the data is not duplicated, fraudulent, or incorrect.

Authentication checks whether the entered credentials match any existing profile so that the system can present the right data with the appropriate authority.

The authentication process requires a medium through which the user enters their details. For example, the prompt asking for a username and password is an authenticating medium. Then these credentials are examined and appropriate information is presented.

Both of the processes deal with extremely sensitive private information. Companies have to pay compensation and legal fines if any of this data is hacked or breached. Therefore, special care has to be taken while integrating these processes into your product.

Developing secure systems for the identification and authentication of users can be expensive. The system architecture has to be designed with proper [security for customers](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/how-businesses-approach-customer-security/) and has to be updated as the regulations change.

This calls for hiring more senior engineers to build the system. With that, the auxiliary requirements also increase. Not to mention, the time-to-market increases too.

This is a challenge for freelancers and small businesses.

Fortunately, the no-code revolution solves that quickly.


## What is No-Code?

As the name suggests, no code is a process of developing applications through a graphical interface that requires zero coding. No-code development helps professionals with no coding knowledge create applications with ease.

All you need to know is your requirements and you are ready to go.

No-code development is beneficial for small teams with limited resources. The time-to-market is greatly reduced and the product can be developed at much lower costs.

Let’s take a look at how no-code technology has improved the identification and [authentication process for businesses](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/why-business-needs-robust-identity-authentication/).


## How No-Code Technology Improves Identification and Authentication?


### 1. Faster development of complex processes.

The visual development environment provided by no-code technology comes with drag-and-drop templates. These templates are working blocks of code that can be used to build authentication and identification processes. This speeds up the process and shortens the overall development time.

Capgemini has shown that moving to a no-code framework has made their development processes 5.5x faster.


### 2. Ease of use.

You don’t need to have any kind of coding knowledge to build an authentication system for your business on a no-code framework.

One of the most important reasons for that is its understandability. Code is difficult to understand as it is a machine-level language. Problem solvers think on an algorithmic level. That is easy to put on paper and translate to a product by using no-code technology.


### 3. Saves a lot of resources.

No-code development requires fewer engineers. This reduces all the auxiliaries that are needed by a business. For instance, less infrastructure, lower financial investment, etc. The most important resource saved is time.

Updating processes and systems that were created using no-code technology is also easier. Often, it is taken care of by the platform.

### 4. Increased customer satisfaction.

Secure identification and authentication processes created on a no-code framework allow businesses to deliver more value to their customers.

It assures secured storage of accurate data for each customer. This helps product managers to deliver a more personalized service to their customers. Another reason is that it assists customer success executives to solve the problems of each customer accurately.

Through [customer service software](https://hiverhq.com/customer-service-software), businesses can understand critical customer service metrics and derive actionable data about support quality. These tools leverage no-code authentication to help the customer-facing teams fetch the right information at the right time.

With increased customer satisfaction, there come a lot of benefits, such as higher customer retention and positive word of mouth.


## Conclusion

Identification and authentication are two major processes that secure customer data and enable companies to deliver a good service. 

The good news is that no-code technologies are helping businesses secure their services by enabling the developers to create processes faster.
