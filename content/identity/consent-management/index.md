When the foundation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was officially laid out, it prompted a rising need for organizations running on [Customer Identity & Access Management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/06/customer-identity-and-access-management/) (CIAM) solutions to re-consider their security arrangements. 

To complement, LoginRadius introduces its Consent Management feature that offers a secure platform to support the European Union's [GDPR compliance capabilities](https://www.loginradius.com/gdpr-and-privacy/).

## Intend Behind The Launch

Customer data is at the epicenter of brand engagements today. With customer expectations dramatically shifting over the last couple of years, individuals demand customization and more control while interacting with brands online. 

GDPR exposed the world to a whole lot of data security concerns ranging from how to collect, store, get consent, and use personal information. The aim was to provide mutual benefits for companies and end-users by building stronger trust relationships.

LoginRadius Consent Management will help companies and their security professionals understand the core mechanism of GDPR requirements and improve customer experience in the process.

## A Final Word
