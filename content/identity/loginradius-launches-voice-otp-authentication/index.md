While enterprises jump on the digital transformation bandwagon to deliver seamless customer experiences across various touchpoints, securing their digital assets often needs to be noticed.

Undoubtedly, secure authentication is paramount in a world where the sophistication of data and privacy breaches have negatively impacted the online business landscape. 

Hence, robust yet streamlined authentication security becomes the need of the hour. 

Recognizing the need for advanced and inclusive user authentication, LoginRadius, a global leader in customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions, has recently unveiled Voice OTP – an innovative security feature set to redefine how users access their accounts.

Let’s explore how Voice OTP would revolutionize the modern digital business landscape.

## What is Voice OTP? 

Voice OTP is a security feature that delivers one-time passcodes to users via a voice call for authentication and verification. Introducing Voice OTP alongside SMS is a strategic initiative to address issues related to user access and authentication reliability proactively. 

This dual-feature approach on the LoginRadius platform ensures user access security, particularly when SMS delivery may face obstacles, thereby enhancing user trust and experience. 

Furthermore, the implementation of Voice OTP significantly enhances authentication and security measures by transmitting passcodes through secure voice calls. This effectively reduces the risk of [unauthorized access](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/authentication-vulnerabilities-security/), as passwords are shared only when the customer answers the phone, thereby ensuring user privacy and strengthening overall account protection.

## Privacy and Security at the Forefront

One of the key highlights of Voice OTP is its commitment to ensuring the highest level of privacy. Unlike traditional methods, Voice OTP shares passcodes only when users respond to calls, minimizing the risk of interception.

This feature becomes particularly valuable when SMS delivery may encounter difficulties, guaranteeing uninterrupted account access and providing a smooth and dependable user experience.

## Inclusivity as a Core Value

Beyond its security enhancements, Voice OTP embraces inclusivity by catering to individuals with disabilities, especially the visually impaired. By allowing OTPs to be played aloud, this feature ensures accessibility for a broader audience, reflecting LoginRadius' commitment to creating solutions that are not only secure but also inclusive.

According to Rakesh Soni, CEO of LoginRadius, "_Innovation at LoginRadius goes beyond just security; it means empowering users with confidence in every digital interaction. Voice OTP reflects our commitment to redefining authentication for a seamless and secure future._"

## Reliability Across Varied Business Environments

Voice OTP is designed to accommodate businesses of all sizes, delivering OTP calls simultaneously without performance issues. Its reliability surpasses traditional SMS OTPs, remaining unaffected by network congestion and ensuring OTP calls reach users even in challenging network conditions. 

This reliability is a significant advantage for businesses, providing a secure and dependable alternative for user authentication. 

## Global Reach and User-Friendly Interactions

With a global reach and user-friendly interactions, Voice OTP further emphasizes LoginRadius' commitment to providing a [secure, convenient, and reliable alternative for user authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/digital-privacy-best-practices/) in today's dynamic digital landscape.
