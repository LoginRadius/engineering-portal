## Introduction

We’re in a digitally advanced modern world that’s swiftly heading towards adopting technology in every space that creates a flawless experience for everyone. 

Whether we talk about private enterprises or government agencies in the public sector, every organization is putting its best foot forward to leverage technology to deliver rich consumer experiences. 

However, specific challenges related to different aspects may come across the government agencies while they craft the best experiences for the citizens. 

One such aspect is the citizens’ access control for various services in a state. 

Government agencies deploy new inter-connected platforms to help their citizens smoothly access the services by invoking technology's true potential. There remain specific challenges that require immediate attention. 

Let’s learn more about [access control in government agencies](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/loginradius-digital-identity-to-build-the-public-sector-of-the-future/) and the challenges hindering an excellent consumer experience. 


### 1. User experience

Delivering a flawless user experience is perhaps the most crucial challenge among government agencies working to bridge the gap between citizens and various government platforms. 

Almost everyone interacts with huge brands online and is well-aware of a [great user experience](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/4-tips-secure-frictionless-ux/). Hence they expect the same level from government agencies’ online portals. 

This becomes quite a big challenge since these agencies are continuously operating on peak loads, and it isn’t possible to manage such enormous demands and maintain a great user experience. 

Reliable consumer identity and access management solution (CIAM) here can be a game-changer since it supports millions of users with auto-scale capabilities. This means every user enjoys a seamless user experience even in the peak loads. 


### 2. Outdated infrastructure

Since government platforms aren’t regularly updated, they become increasingly vulnerable to several new attacks. Whether it’s outdated software or poor security mechanisms, both can lead to diverse issues that may grant unauthorized users quick back door access. 

Hence, updating the overall IT infrastructure and deploying adequate security mechanisms in government agencies’ platforms are significant challenges that require immediate attention.

### 3. Security

Poor security and inadequate data management are the most overlooked aspects that are increasingly becoming the bottlenecks of the current modern sectors backed by government agencies.

Agencies that cannot protect consumer identity and personal information are prone to losing trust over citizens and would undoubtedly fail to bridge the gap between the government and 

Adding stringent layers of security is a must for any retailer seeking substantial growth in the ever-expanding competitive business landscape.

Whether it’s [multi-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-factor-authentication/) (MFA) or [risk-based authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/risk-based-authentication/) (RBA), enterprises need to quickly put their best foot forward in adopting advanced security measures to safeguard consumer information to prevent financial and reputational losses.


### 4. Engagement

Engaging citizens to keep coming back is pretty complicated regarding the challenges of government agencies working to build the public sector. 

Building trust over citizens is quite daunting but can do wonders for agencies if done correctly by leveraging perfect harmony of personalization and a seamless user experience.

LoginRadius simplifies the user registration process through a seamless experience with social sign-in and single sign-on.



* **Social Sign-In:** Customers tend to remember the credentials of their frequently used network. Social sign-in is the method of one-click authentication with a social media account. It reduces the hassles of the registration process and helps a great deal in converting a random user to a value-added customer.
* **Single Sign-On:** It means a user can access multiple accounts with a single set of credentials. It offers ease of authentication and reduces the risk of minimizing poor password habits.

When citizens are offered frictionless onboarding coupled with quick login options, they eventually build trust and become frequent visitors, ultimately improving overall engagement. 


### 5. Underfunding 

Another critical challenge among the government agencies is that they cannot spend enough on their overall IT infrastructure. 

Since the government platforms also require adequate infrastructure and updated security mechanisms, the limited budget allocated by the local governments hinders their ability to attract citizens as their website/app lacks basic security features. 

More and more citizens demand intelligent and intuitive online services from government agencies, which means more funds are required from the government to meet the surging demands. 


## Final Thoughts 

Government agencies must incorporate technology to embark on a digital transformation journey that enhances the consumer experience and strengthens overall security. 

When it comes to adopting citizen access control, government agencies should incorporate a [consumer identity and access management (CIAM) ](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/)system that helps manage millions of consumer identities and reinforces overall security.
