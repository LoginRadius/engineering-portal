## Introduction 

Identity-first security is revolutionizing the way businesses protect themselves. It's a new approach to protecting data and devices that increases productivity, preserves trust, drives compliance, and helps your business grow.

And [identity management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-iam/) is undoubtedly the new leadership model for data protection and business growth. It helps businesses drive better security outcomes, ensuring business growth while improving customer experiences.

Whether we talk about overall user experience or customer identity security, organizations are now concerned about every aspect of their business that may affect customer acquisition. 

The world witnessed a paradigm shift amid the outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic. And business leaders learned a crucial lesson — to invoke the potential of remote opportunities with the next level of agility and security. 

However, the pandemic era also resulted in a sudden increase in cyberattacks on businesses that adopted poor lines of defense while offering remote access to employees. 

Hence, an identity-first security mechanism became the need of the hour to mitigate the risks and offer a seamless user experience. 

Let’s uncover the aspects of incorporating identity-first security and how businesses can seamlessly navigate their digital success. 


## What is Identity-First Security? Why does it Matter Now More Than Ever Before? 

Organizations have offered far more freedom to their employees than ever before. The hybrid working environments and remote-first job opportunities have drastically changed how businesses handle security. 

However, the sudden shift to remote working environments and dynamic business landscape has increased the threat vectors since the conventional network firewalls aren’t potent to offer robust security. 

On the other hand, secure access to critical business information and resources has become the utmost priority for businesses amid the [rising data breaches](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/cybersecurity-attacks-business/). 

Hence, a robust identity and access management system became necessary for businesses to secure their networks. 

Here’s where the crucial role of identity-first security came into play. 

Identity-first security can help mitigate risks and ensure strong identity controls. Security is a top concern for organizations as they work to protect their data, systems, and customers. 

Identity-first security helps mitigate risks and ensure strong identity controls by setting the stage for secure access across managed or unmanaged devices powered by automated lifecycle management activities. 

With an identity-first security approach, businesses can:

* Ensure that only those people who are authorized to access your data can do so.
* Automate lifecycle management activities to help you keep up with the ever-changing nature of employee roles, responsibilities, and devices.
* Ensure access is granted to the right person at the right time via automated processes without compromising security.
* Offer stringent layers of security through [multi-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-factor-authentication/) (MFA) and risk-based authentication (RBA)

## The Crucial Role of An Identity Management Platform

Invoking the true potential of identity-first security requires modern businesses to leverage a robust identity management platform offering several security features. 

A [customer identity and access management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/) (CIAM) solution can be the best thing that can help mitigate the risks of identity thefts or sensitive business data breaches. 

Moreover, a CIAM solution also helps meet all the necessary security and privacy compliances, ensuring the highest data security and privacy level.
