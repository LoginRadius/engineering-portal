## Introduction:

Today's customers live online and don't limit their lives to a particular app or website. They want to use any device and access any resource from any place, at any time, or anywhere in the world. 

With this new, flexible digital freedom comes a whole new world of friction for businesses and enterprises — the conflict of continually entering usernames, passwords, and other credentials, even across the multiple devices customers use today.

From there, the authorization system takes responsibility for collecting all additional data required to make the right authorization decision.

Dynamic authorization is designed to reduce security risks by providing an extra layer of protection for your most important information.  It is a method of authentication that allows mobile apps to make requests for user data without actually asking for it. You only need to define your criteria once and then let the system decide based on what happens later on in the process.

Dynamic authorizationensures that every employee has only the right amount of access to information based on their role in the company, which is critical to [preventing accidental data leaks](https://www.loginradius.com/security/) or hacking attempts. In addition to giving you complete control over who can see what data, it also allows for granular control over how data is accessed.
