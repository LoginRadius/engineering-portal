## Introduction

The past two years were full of uncertainties amid the global pandemic and have been highly disruptive in terms of economy, human lives, and rising cybersecurity threats. 

Yes, for a couple of years, the way we use technology has taken a paradigm shift since the remote working ecosystem, and remote access became the new normal. 

Talking about the cybersecurity threats, the attackers explored new ways to exploit organizations by targeting their employees and users by surpassing frail security mechanisms in the past few years. 

However, the new year’s projections can’t be the same, just as similar to the previous year; the challenges in the upcoming years could be even worse. 

As the idea of smart cities comes into existence and more and more cities jump on the technology bandwagon to enhance experiences, the risks from security threats increase. 

Here’s a list of potential security trends that every individual, business, or organization must keep in mind and ensure they remain safe by adopting [appropriate security measures](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/maintaining-quality-data-security-practices/). 


### 1. Supply chain cyber attacks will continue to surge 

We’ve witnessed a substantial increase in the number of cyberattacks that mainly targeted software supply chains. These kinds of attacks are proven to be highly destructive since they can quickly take down an organization’s overall software supply chain coupled with services. 

Unfortunately, in the New Year 2022, these kinds of supply chain attacks will become even more common since attackers are now considering these attacks as an effective mode of mass disruption within an organization. 


### 2. Smart devices and nagging risks 

The idea of smart cities is incomplete without the intervention of IoT devices that create an interconnected network of smart devices. 

However, the Internet of Things is inevitably a swiftly growing trend associated with many cybersecurity threats. 

In the past year, several instances of data breaches through IoT networks have been reported in the past year. The incidents mostly took place because of the inadequate machine-to-machine access control. 

Hackers can quickly attack through several vulnerable devices, including security cameras, smart DVRs, or smart home assistants. 

The same or even worse is expected in the year 2022 and beyond.

### 3. The rise of tractor hackers 

The advancement of technology has undoubtedly offered endless possibilities and has exposed every industry to significant cyber threats. 

Farming is also one of the most vulnerable industries facing numerous challenges for the past couple of years, and in 2022, it will surely be under the spotlight for cyberattackers.

Many modern tractors now run software just like cars and are more susceptible to attacks that can cause financial losses. 

Also, remote farming and automation in this industry have posed severe challenges and threats, including disruption of food supply chains. 


### #4. Shareware attack

Shareware is commercial software that is distributed to consumers for free. It is usually handed out as complimentary software to encourage users to pay for the parent software. Mostly, shareware is safe, but it can be risky at times.

Many organizations have fallen prey to these kinds of shareware attacks in the past couple of years, and the numbers are increasing swiftly. 

In 2022, cybercriminals may use it to distribute malware that could lead to malicious attacks. Organizations may put themselves at risk of unwanted exposure.


### 5. Ransomware will continue to exploit organizations and individuals

When it comes to cybersecurity threats, ransomware attacks are undeniably at the forefront of cybercriminals since they provide hefty monetary benefits. 

Last year, ransomware was the most significant concern among cybersecurity leaders to protect their organizations, employees, and clients. 

With the frequency of ransomware attacks increasing swiftly, [cybersecurity leaders predict](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/tips-from-loginradius-security-expert-2022/) that organizations need to gear up since these kinds of threats quickly would surely rise. 


## The Bottom Line

There has been a substantial increase in the number of cybersecurity threats in the past couple of years, especially after the global pandemic outbreak in 2019. 

Though it’s challenging to deal with any cybersecurity threat, cybersecurity experts always advise every organization, individual, and private sector organization to strengthen their first line of defense for maximum safety. 

The threats mentioned above would continue to rise in the new year. Everyone must put their best foot forward well in advance to avoid tarnishing their market image and mitigate the risk of hefty financial losses.
