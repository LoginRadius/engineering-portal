## Introduction

Incorporating the latest technology in your business processes doesn’t necessarily mean you’re secure from ever-expanding [modern cybersecurity threats](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/cybersecurity-attacks-business/). 

When we talk about various cyber threats, most of them are focused on bypassing the weak layer of authentication on online platforms that affect crucial business data and eventually put sensitive consumer information at risk. 

So, does it mean that most cybercriminals attack users and exploit businesses by targeting weak authentication and login mechanisms? 

Unfortunately, yes! 

And to minimize the risk, businesses first need to understand the fundamental difference when comparing authentication vs. login. Once they know the aspects of authentication vs. login, the next step is to ensure a stringent layer of security for their users. 


## What is Authentication?

Authentication is identifying users and validating who they claim to be. One of the most common and apparent factors in authenticating identity is a password. 

If the user name matches the password credential, the identity is valid, and the system grants access to the user.

Interestingly, with enterprises going passwordless, many use [modern authentication techniques](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/) like one-time passcodes (OTP) via SMS, or email, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometrics, etc. authenticate users and deploy security beyond what passwords usually provide.


## What is Login? 

In computer and information security, logging in is the standard process through which an individual gains access to specific resources, computer systems, or networks once they’re identified and authenticated. 

User credentials are typically used in a username, and a password is referred to as a login. 

In a nutshell, logging in to a device, database, computer, account, or network system through a username and password is called login. 


## Vulnerabilities Associated with Authentication and Login 



* **Lack of password complexity:** It's one thing to educate your consumers about password complexity; for example, they should use upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. But it is an entirely different story when you take the initiative to implement it. Ensure that for every account, a consumer's password is unique. That means no repeats. 
* **Brute-force attacks:** When hackers use a trial and error method to guess correct passwords, that's a [brute-force attack](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/brute-force-lockout/). Hackers use dedicated tools to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed. Usually, these attacks are automated using a list of frequently used usernames and passwords.
* **User-generated credentials:** When consumers create their passwords, there is always a possibility that they will come up with credentials that are weak and easily vulnerable to cyber attacks. Consumers may subconsciously skip password security best practices because they are more inclined to have something easy to remember. As a result, hackers can adjust their brute-force systems and crack open passwords in no time.
* **Unpatched security vulnerabilities:** While thousands of threats are discovered daily, one of the most significant risks an organization may take is failing to repair or "patch" specific vulnerabilities once they are found. It is quite common for consumers to dismiss the "update available" alerts in some programs because they do not want to waste a few minutes. They aren't aware that updating patches can save them from severe cyberattacks.
* **Social engineering attacks:** It happens when hackers psychologically manipulate consumers into giving up their login credentials. Common warning signs of [social engineering attacks](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/social-engineering-attacks/) include asking for immediate assistance, luring with too good to be true offers, and threatening reprimands if their requests are ignored.


## How a Cutting-Edge CIAM Like LoginRadius Helps Overcome Such Vulnerabilities?

When we talk about authentication vs. login, the most crucial aspect that businesses shouldn’t miss is how they can overcome all the security challenges. 

And to overcome these challenges, businesses should incorporate a reliable new-age consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution like LoginRadius that helps strengthen security without hampering the overall user experience.

The [LoginRadius CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/) simplifies every business task that deals with your customers individually, including those that haven’t registered on your site yet. CIAM seamlessly links authentication, customer management, sales, marketing, business intelligence, and services with a single data hub for all identities.

Here’s what LoginRadius CIAM offers: 


### #1.  Security for data and accounts. 

LoginRadius provides essential security features that safeguard data and account access. For example, with risk-based authentication, each customer’s usage and login patterns are monitored, making it easy to spot unusual (potentially fraudulent) activity.

For use cases where you need an extra layer of security, you can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), which verifies a customer’s identity by requiring a second step, such as entering an SMS code or clicking an email link.

Your secure login procedures reassure customers that they are safe using your services—something that’s essential with the number of public data breaches reaching the news.


### #2. Advanced login options 

In the CIAM landscape, a business can gain an advantage by implementing new and advanced login options offered by LoginRadius that are not yet widely adopted. These login methods further improve customer experience, customer trust, or both.

LoginRadius CIAM offers various new-age secure login options, including: 



* Passwordless login
* One-touch login
* Smart login 


### #3. Scalability and uptime

With just one customer identity management system that’s fully managed for you, reliability is maximized, and the need for resources is kept to a minimum. LoginRadius’ centralized login system for all of your apps and services makes it easy to add new services as they come online. 

A [cloud implementation](https://www.loginradius.com/cloud-directory/) can quickly scale up or down depending on your usage, and automated failover can cut downtime to virtually zero.


## Final Thoughts 

When we talk about authentication vs. login, the security of both users and businesses shouldn’t be compromised no matter what authentication method an enterprise uses. 

Since most cyberattacks are targeted by bypassing the weak authentication layer, enterprises must understand the importance of reliable consumer identity and access management solution. 

LoginRadius CIAM platform is designed to help businesses reach their targeted goals by enhancing the consumer experience, improving overall authentication security, and meeting regulatory compliances.
