# Passwordless Login- A Beginner's Guide

Passwordless login verifies consumer identities without using passwords or any other memorized credentials. 

The consumer is confirmed with the help of a possession factor, which can be an object that uniquely identifies the user with an email (link) or SMS (OTP) sent to the registered email address or phone number, respectively. 

Once the link or OTP is verified, the consumer will be logged into the account. 

## Why Should You Use Passwordless Login

Passwordless Login makes life easier as you do not need to remember different passwords anymore. 

Can you exactly recall which accounts what passwords belong to? How frequently do you reuse the same password because you can't have a unique, strong, and easily-remembered password for each of your accounts? 

Passwordless Login takes the frustration out of the equation to create a better consumer experience.


## How is Passwordless Login Useful for Business


- It improves consumer experience, particularly mobile applications because users only need an email address or mobile phone number to sign up.
- It enhances security. Passwords are a significant vulnerability as consumers reuse passwords and share them with others. Passwords are the most significant attack vector and are responsible for a substantial percentage of breaches and attacks such as corporate account takeover, [credentials stuffing](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2019/09/prevent-credential-stuffing-attacks/), and brute force attacks.
- It reduces the total cost of ownership, as managing passwords is expensive (implementing password complexity policies, password expiration, password reset processes, password hashing and storing, breached password detection).  

## How to Implement Passwordless Login

Passwordless Login can be implemented with the following method.


- Passwordless Login with Email
- Passwordless Login with OTP (SMS)

When using passwordless authentication with SMS, consumers:


- Provide a cell phone number instead of a userID/password.
- Receive a one-time-passcode (OTP) via text message (SMS).
- Enter the OTP on the login screen to access the application.

When using passwordless authentication with email, consumers:


- Provide email address or user name.
- Receive a one-time-passcode (OTP) via email or a magic link.
- Enter the OTP on the login screen or just link on the magic link which login the user.

**To implement passwordless, you'll need to make two decisions:**


1. What will be the authentication method you want to use ( Email/SMS with one-time-passcode, or Email with a Magic Link enclosed)
2. Or if you are going to implement the authentication using Embedded Login or Standard Login.

Once you have decided what kind of implementation you want, you can choose any desired solution you would require for the authentication process.

**Passwordless Login with Text Message (SMS)**

The consumer is prompted to enter a phone number, and the system will send a one-time-use code to that phone number via the SMS gateway. Thereafter the consumer enters the one-time passcode into your website/application.

When the phone number linked to the code verifies an existing user, the authenticator will authorize the consumer. If the consumer is new, a profile is created for the text message connection before it authenticates the consumer.

You can also configure the OTP length and the duration of its expiry for security best practices. 

**Passwordless Login with Email**

The consumer is prompted to provide an email address, to which the authenticator sends a one-time-passcode. The consumer then inputs the code into your application. If the email address attached to the code matches an existing user, the server will identify and validate it.

If the consumer is new, then a profile is created for the email connection. This will be before the authentication authenticates the consumer. You can also configure the OTP length and the duration of its expiry for [security best practices](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2020/12/data-security-best-practices/). 

**Passwordless Login with Magic Links**

An email with a link is sent to the user. The link allows users to log in instantly just by clicking on it. It is similar to getting an email with a one-time-passcode in it. Once the user receives the code, redirects the app for authentication, and enters the code, the magic link will help to avoid these steps and authenticate directly. 

The initial request for the link and response should take place in the same browser. Either the transaction will fail. So this way you will get an additional security layer with easy and simple steps.


## Conclusion

Now you know the security advantages of passwordless logins, you might probably be admiring what other perks implementing a similar system will have for your company or organization.

Passwordless Login provides consumers the most beneficial of both worlds: consumers can retain their payment information securely on file, preserving time in the future, and they wonâ€™t have to memorize a long, difficult password, which will prompt repeat transactions. Furthermore, your consumers are more likely to execute [impulse acquisitions](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/02/attract-consumers-to-your-website/) when the process is much easier.
