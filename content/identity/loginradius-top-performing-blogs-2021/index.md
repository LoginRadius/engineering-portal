### #10. How to Set Up Two-factor Authentication on All Your Online Accounts?

Two-factor authentication is one of the best security methods that use two layers to verify a consumer's identity. 

This means, rather than simply entering the password to log into an account, two-factor authentication requires a code sent via text message to the consumer's phone number or generated through an app.

Read this blog to learn everything about two-factor authentication, [how to set up two-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/how-to-setup-2fa-in-online-accounts/) on your social accounts, and its importance. 


### #9. What Is a Salt and How Does It Boost Security?

Salting hashes sounds like something that comes out of a recipe book. However, Salt plays a significant role in preventing a data breach in cryptography. 

While data leaks can sometimes happen, hash salting generators only come to mind when there is a significant invasion of privacy that affects the majority of the consumers’ applications.

Read this blog to know more about [Salt](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-salt/), utilizing hashing using Salt, and its importance in enhancing overall password security. 


### #8. Identity Management in Cloud Computing

[Identity management in cloud computing]((https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/identity-management-in-cloud-computing/)) is the subsequent identity and access management (IAM) solution. 

However, it is a lot more than merely a straightforward web app single sign-on (SSO) solution. This next generation of IAM solution is a holistic move of the identity provider right to the cloud.

This blog covers all the aspects of cloud IAM, its significance, and businesses must incline towards a modern cloud identity management solution. 


### #7. A Detailed Guide on How UX/UI Affects Registration

Login is a big deal that decides the entire UX your website will deliver. Businesses should try to put as little resistance as possible into their registration process. 

As with it comes customer identities—the most accurate first-party data beneficial for conversions and customer retention.

[This blog](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/how-ui-ux-affects-registration/) covers all the aspects associated with UI/UX along with the numerous benefits of using social login for your online platforms. 


### #6. What Is Broken Authentication and How to Prevent Your Company From It

When the hacker gains access into the system admin's account by using the online platform's vulnerabilities, particularly in two areas: credential management and session management, it's referred to as broken authentication.

Poor credential management and poor session management always lead to broken authentication. Read on this blog to know everything about [broken authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-broken-authentication/), its consequences, and how to prevent it. 


### #5. Refresh Tokens: When to Use Them and How They Interact with JWTs

A token plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall security mechanism of an organization that helps to deliver flawless and secure authentication and authorization on their website or application. 

With token security, users have to re-authenticate themselves for obvious security reasons by offering credentials to sign in if the access token is expired. 

However, this can be tedious and hampers user experience. To overcome this, the concept of refresh tokens was introduced.

This blog provides an overview of using [refresh tokens](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/refresh-tokens-jwt-interaction/) and helps securely authenticate users without hampering their overall experience. 


### #4. The Rise of BYOI (Bring your own Identity)

Consumers demand a more innovative experience today. They don't like to create a new ID whenever they want to utilize a service. Instead, they are open to leveraging their existing digital identity securely and efficiently, with the opportunity to reuse it in multiple domains.

And as a response to this demand, businesses have come up with a concept called Bring Your Own Identity (BYOI).

Read on this blog to learn every aspect of [BYOI](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/bring-your-own-identity/). 


### #3. What is a Token? What are its Pros and Cons?

### #2. How NIST is Changing Password Creation in 2021?

To cope with the increasing number of cyber frauds and data thefts, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued specific requirements and controls for digital user identities.

The NIST has dispensed several guidelines that ensure security to the user and eventually help enterprises secure their crucial business information.

These guidelines offer recommendations for users for creating strong passwords and suggestions for vendors/verifiers handling passwords.

[This blog](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/nist-password-guidelines-2021/) provides detailed information about NIST password guidelines and offers valuable insights into how businesses can ensure maximum security in 2021 and beyond.


### #1. The Future of Authentication is Passwordless With Magic links

This is perhaps the most popular blog that depicts the importance of passwordless in the modern digital world. 

A passwordless magic link allows you to log in directly with the help of a link that is received through an email. This process is similar to receiving a one-time password (OTP) though you might have to physically enter the OTP once you are redirected to the page or application. 

In the case of passwordless magic links, all you have to do is click on the link sent through an email, allowing you to log in directly.

[Read on this insightful blog](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/passwordless-magic-links/) that covers all the aspects of passwordless login, challenges, and how organizations can use magic links for going passwordless.
