We are thrilled to announce a series of leadership changes at LoginRadius, marking the beginning of an exhilarating new chapter amid strategic growth. As an Enterprise SaaS company with teams in the USA, Canada, and India, we are dedicated to serving our global customer base with innovative solutions in the Customer IAM space.

## Acknowledging Contributions and Embracing New Beginnings

With a mix of gratitude and anticipation, LoginRadius bids farewell to Mr. Deepak Gupta, who served as the company’s CTO and a Director of the Board. Mr. Gupta joined LoginRadius as Software Development Manager in March 2015, advancing to CTO in May 2018, before transitioning to a contractor role in Aug 2022. In December 2023, he fully concluded his journey with the company. His leadership and technical expertise were instrumental in establishing LoginRadius' robust foundation and fostering a culture of innovation. As Mr. Gupta embarks on new endeavors, we wish him the best.
