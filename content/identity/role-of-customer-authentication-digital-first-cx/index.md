## Introduction

In a fast-paced digital business landscape, digital agility is undeniably becoming the backbone of enterprises striving to stay ahead of the curve. 

And when we talk about overall business growth, we can’t overlook the role of [customer authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/) in reinforcing digital agility for thriving business success. 

With digital agility, businesses can easily and rapidly update, change, or adapt their processes to meet current and future customer needs and opportunities. 

Just like agility is the way to move quickly and easily, digital agility is now the means to adopt digital transformation quickly and easily through the right tools and processes. And customer authentication plays a vital role in incorporating digital agility. 

Let’s understand the aspects of digital agility and how businesses can ensure they’re on the right path to achieving digital agility through the right customer authentication tools and technologies. 


## What is Digital Agility? What’s the Role of Customer Authentication in Invoking the Potential of Digital Agility? 

Digital agility is the ease with which any organization can adapt to changing business needs – by enabling or changing their business processes. 

And for a [successful digital transformation](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/4-things-consider-starting-digital-transformation/), organizations need to invest in resilient business operations, consumer experience initiatives, and technology. 

And how do you go about achieving your business objectives in digital agility? Among its primary building blocks, identity and access management (or IAM) can help in bringing business agility into any organization.

Traditionally, IAM has always been viewed as an effective security solution necessary for software applications and mobile apps. In short, it has been used solely to ensure the right person has access to the right resource. This is true, but IAM is now much more than simply acting as an authentication tool.

[Customer identity and access management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/) (CIAM) has changed how businesses leverage customer insights and provide authentication to users without hampering the overall user experience. 


## How a CIAM Solution Helps Paving the Way for Digital Agility? 

For effective digital transformation, technology-enabled companies must move from a fixed and rigid IT infrastructure – to a more flexible and component-based API architecture, which can easily be reconstructed or reused. 

And, we shall see how an API-based consumer identity and access management (or CIAM) can be the foundation of digital agility and transformation.

A robust CIAM solution helps businesses stay ahead of the competition by offering valuable insights that help invoke the true potential of digital agility, including:



* Which users or identities require access rights to the applications?
* How can they go about utilizing these applications?
* What resources do they need for access?
* How can you prevent unauthorized access to the applications?
* How many times does a user access the application?

This information helps businesses quickly understand user demands and can eventually prepare strategies for future requirements.
