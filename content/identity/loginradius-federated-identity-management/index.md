Back in the day, when consumers wanted to access different sites and applications, they had to register first, and then log in with their usernames and passwords every single time. Such experiences are no longer acceptable to consumers and they choose to opt-out of such services.

The recently launched Federated Identity Management by LoginRadius is an arrangement to simplify the implementation of [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.loginradius.com/single-sign-on/) and user experience across applications. 

## Intent Behind the Launch

Federated Identity Management by LoginRadius helps businesses and applications use a single set of identity data. Consumers need not create multiple accounts for multiple organizations to access their web applications. These applications do not  communicate with each other directly and standard SSO protocols like JWT, SAML, OAuth 2.0, OIDC etc are used to establish the communication.

[Federated Identity Management](https://www.loginradius.com/federated-sso/) is designed by LoginRadius to help your business in the following ways: 

- **Gain access across multiple applications**: It helps applications work together, so consumers can access multiple applications without requiring a new access credential.

- **Seamless consumer authentication**: It provides seamless access to applications, making the consumer experience quicker, simpler, and more convenient. 

- **Cost-effectiveness**: It lowers the administrative cost as the support for maintenance of web pages like login, register, access management, consumer management is not required to be managed by your organization.

- **Highly secure model**: Because there is no direct communication with multiple service providers, passwords aren't exposed, leading to higher levels of security.
