## Introduction

When we talk about the digital transformation of a business, enterprises focus more on incorporating the latest technologies in terms of hardware and software updates but don’t emphasize the security of their systems, which isn’t a good decision overall. 

Since businesses focus on delivering a rich consumer experience to their customers and employees, security is often overlooked, and enterprises incorporate security at a fundamental level. 

Many would argue that [balancing security with user experience](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/balancing-security-cx/) is quite challenging and would choose user experience every time. 

So, what’s the secret ingredient of creating a perfect symphony of user experience without compromising security?
