## Introduction

In a world where cloud adoption is quickly becoming the new normal, enterprises are quickly putting their best foot forward in adopting cloud-based identity management solutions. 

And when it comes to [identity modernization](https://blog.loginradius.com/identity/identity-modernization-business-success-2022/), it’s swiftly becoming the need of the hour! 

Identity modernization could be defined as shifting from managing identities through on-premises identity providers to a cloud-based identity management solution. 

Moreover, it could also be a shift from one cloud to multiple clouds. 

However, the biggest question is - does my business need to worry about the latest trends in the identity management landscape, especially for identity modernization?

To answer this question, let’s explore what [identity management](https://blog.loginradius.com/identity/scale-business-with-identity-management/) means to modern businesses and how enterprises can leverage the true potential of cloud-based identity management solutions. 


## Identity Modernization and Security- What You Shouldn’t Ignore

Though businesses have been leveraging identity management solutions for decades, certain challenges pertaining to identity security and user experience raise the demand for a modern infrastructure to handle complex identity ecosystems. 

Also, with the sudden move to the cloud and rapid SaaS adoption, things became more complicated considering identity management. And the legacy, on-premises infrastructure with built-in identity and access management systems became impotent against increasing cloud threats. 

Moreover, the paradigm shift to remote working ecosystems has increased the risk of identity thefts and compromised accounts since cybercriminals could easily bypass frail layers of security, especially when users are remotely connected to a single network. 

Hence, the need for identity modernization becomes more crucial. 

Identity modernization is the process of shifting from conventional on-premise identity systems to a cloud-based identity management system that helps reinforce overall identity security against modern threat vectors.

While most businesses have already put their best foot forward in adopting robust cloud-based identity management solutions, many are just wondering and waiting for a breach to change their decision. 


## How to Make the Big Move to Identity Modernization? 

We’ve learned how identity modernization is becoming an absolute necessity considering the current threat landscape. But the big question is- how to make the big move to modernize identity management.
