## Introduction

The modern digital landscape is about delivering customers the best user experience at every touch point. However, it doesn’t mean that security could be compromised while crafting the best user experiences. 

However, many organizations catering to clients online strongly believe that either they could deliver a great user experience or add multiple layers of security that would add more friction while users interact with their platform. 

So, does it mean that renowned brands that have established their business over the years aren’t concerned with the security and privacy of their customers? And do they have an excellent fortune in [safeguarding their customers’ identities](https://www.loginradius.com/security/)? 

Unfortunately, that is not true! 

Businesses have leveraged a robust customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution for years to secure customer identities and eventually deliver a seamless user experience across multiple touchpoints. 

Let’s figure out how a CIAM does wonders for a business while creating a perfect user experience and security harmony. 


## How CIAM Offers a Great User Experience and Robust Security?

With a customer identity and access management solution, businesses could leverage the true potential of [seamless authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/) in a number of ways. For example, users can sign in or sign up through their email, social media, or phone. And this gives them a seamless experience since the old-school user id password method doesn't work in today's era. 

On the other hand, when it comes to security, a cloud-based CIAM like LoginRadius offers MFA and RBA to ensure the highest level of customer data security, even in high-risk situations.

In a nutshell, businesses need not compromise security while crafting the best user experience for their customers when they choose a reliable CIAM. 

Aside from playing a vital role in enhancing consumers' experience as they interact with brands, CIAM is also a seamless business enabler. The best CIAM platforms deliver seamless registration, secure consumer identity management, and control of consumer access to applications, systems, and services.

Being a solution that simplifies the entire consumer experience - CIAM is now seen as a business enabler. It allows consumers to connect across devices and touchpoints in a way that suits them best.


## What if a Business is Already Using a Legacy IAM Solution? 

Many enterprises aren’t aware of the fact that most of the legacy IAM systems may support customer identity management but aren’t designed in a way to deliver security and user experience. 

As a result, most businesses fall prey to various data breaches leading to compromised customers’ identities and crucial business information. 

They have to understand that the conventional IAM systems were designed to function within an organization with a limited number of user identities. And thus, its security aspects were limited, and the user experience part was never emphasized. 

Hence, the one’s still relying on the conventional IAMs should immediately think about switching to a robust CIAM like LoginRadius if they wish to manage heaps of customer identities securely without compromising user experience.
