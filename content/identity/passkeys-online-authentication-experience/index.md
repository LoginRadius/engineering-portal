## Introduction

Passwords have long been the preferred method for authenticating customers online. However, they come with significant security risks due to human behavior—such as insecure sharing, reusing passwords, using personal information in passwords, setting easily guessable passwords, and susceptibility to phishing. 

Despite predictions in the 2000s that passwords would soon become obsolete, they remain the primary method for authentication due to a lack of convenient and secure alternatives.

To combat the [security risks and user experience challenges](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/balancing-security-cx/), LoginRadius introduces Passkeys, which reinvents user authentication. 

## Intent Behind the Launch

With the FIDO2 open standard, [passkey authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/passkeys-login-authentication/) has become straightforward and user-friendly. Widely supported across multiple device platforms and web browsers, passkeys eliminate passwords and their associated risks while enhancing customer experience and security. 

LoginRadius is introducing Passkeys to revolutionize the authentication landscape by providing a secure, convenient, and user-friendly alternative to traditional passwords.

Passkeys by LoginRadius addresses various security challenges in conventional password-based authentication without hampering the overall user experience.
