In a world where rich experiences surround us on every touchpoint, consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions are continuously helping businesses deliver secure and seamless experiences. 

Whether we talk about ensuring adequate [authentication and authorization](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/authentication-vs-authorization-infographic/) or the collection of insightful consumer data, CIAM has undeniably evolved as a game-changer for diverse industries. 

When we consider a CIAM solution, the first thing that comes to mind is a robust identity management mechanism that can provide authentication through numerous ways, including social login, OTP and email login, etc. 

However, the modern CIAM is packed with endless capabilities that ensure robust authentication and eventually help businesses stay ahead of the curve. 

Yes, the latest trends in digital identity experiences can transform a business by thriving productivity coupled with another stringent layer of security. 

Let’s look at some CIAM trends that have revolutionized the IAM market and how businesses can leverage the next generation of consumer identity and access management solutions. 


## #1. Passwordless Authentication

Yes, you heard it correctly. Passwordless authentication is the future of delivering a flawless user experience backed with robust security. 

So, why is passwordless authentication so important?

It’s pretty simple. Passwords are just too easy to guess, hack, or intercept. What’s more, the legacy of password reuse is leading to constant attacks and account vulnerabilities.

A passwordless authentication system swaps the use of a traditional password with more certain factors. These extra-security methods may include a [magic link](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/loginradius-launches-passwordless-login-with-magic-link-or-otp/), fingerprint, PIN, or a secret token delivered via email or text message.

Passwordless Login with Magic Link or OTP feature by LoginRadius gets authentication right by hitting all the right chords—streaming consumer experience, enhancing account security, and improving adaptive safety (to name a few).


## #2. Adaptive Authentication (Risk-based Authentication)

Just like multi-factor authentication, adaptive authentication also verifies an identity but eventually considers certain security risk factors.

[Adaptive Authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/What-is-adaptive-authentication/) (also known as Risk-based Authentication) is a method to send notifications or prompt the consumers to complete an additional step(s) to verify their identities when the authentication request is deemed malicious according to your organization's security policy.

In a nutshell, Adaptive Authentication analyzes the user interaction with your application and intelligently builds a risk profile based on the consumer behavior or your organization's security policy.

The LoginRadius CIAM delivers the highest level of security through a stringent RBA (risk-based authentication) mechanism that’s on the verge of becoming an industry standard. 


## #3. Decentralized Authentication

Decentralized authentication simply means that there is no central authority to verify your identity, i.e., decentralized identifiers. DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are a particular identifier that allows for decentralized, verified digital identification. 

A DID any subject identified by the DID's controller (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.).

DIDs, unlike traditional federated identifiers, are designed to be independent of centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.

Businesses and industries that understand and capture the possibility to apply rising standardized decentralized identification technology for client identification control will create a long-time period of aggressive gain. 

It permits them to leapfrog the opposition and preserve their lead some distance into the future.


## #4.  Zero Trust Security 

The shortcomings of the current cybersecurity system that can be quickly analyzed by hackers that are always on a hunt for finding loopholes can be fixed by implementing a zero-trust security model across the entire network.

Zero trust can be defined as the security concept based on a belief that enterprises shouldn’t automatically trust any device or individual, whether inside or outside its perimeters, and should strictly verify everything before granting access.

In a nutshell, zero trust relies on the principle of “don’t trust anyone.” This architecture cuts all the access points until proper verification is done and trust is established.

No access is provided until the system verifies the individual or device demanding access to the IP address, device, or storage.

This strategic initiative helps prevent data breaches as the concept of trusting anyone is eliminated, even if the access request is from within the network.

Security experts now firmly believe that the conventional security approach is good for nothing, especially in a world where most data breaches are caused by bypassing the corporate firewalls and hackers could move inside a private network without enough resistance.

## #5. Progressive Disclosure 

Since businesses emphasize delivering personalized and rich consumer experiences, progressive disclosure paves the path for the same from the beginning of the onboarding process. 

[Progressive disclosure](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/progressive-disclosure-user-onboarding/) is an innovative interaction design pattern that sequences information and various actions across different screens.

The purpose is to enhance conversion rates by ensuring users don’t switch to competitors because they aren’t getting relevant information when they first interact with a brand.

In a nutshell, progressive disclosure interaction design pattern provides a quick overview of features/content of an application that helps users make better decisions.

Progressive disclosure helps build a seamless experience for users while portraying the necessary information regarding the features and capabilities of a product that helps build trust in a user in the initial yet crucial few seconds of their interaction.

In other words, progressive disclosure streamlines baseline experience as it hides details from users until they need or ask to see them.
