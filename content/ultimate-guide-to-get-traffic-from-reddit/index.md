### **Reddit: Defined**

Reddit was launched in 2005 and since then, it has been a growing platform for entertainment, news and social sharing. The name “Reddit” is derived from two english words- **Read** and **Edit**. Reddit’s users term themselves as Redditors which again follows the same fashion of amalgamation of words- **Reddit** and **Editors**.

**_Up-votes_** (thumbs up) and **_Down-votes_** (thumbs-down) decide ranking of your submissions in Reddit. Besides this, if your comments get upvoted, it will gain you **_comment karma_** and if your link gets upvoted, it earns you **_link karma_**. Correlatively, your link and comment karmas will acquire you more authority in Reddit and correspondingly will increase your upvotes on your link.
