**Do you have a WordPress site?**

**Do you run a business with hundreds or thousands of users?**

Then, you might want your consumers to seamlessly move between your multiple sites without them having to re-enter their credentials, right? 
Asking them to re-authenticate is a cumbersome process. This is where SSO helps you!

Businesses thrive by providing a seamless experience to their consumers. So, yes! Whether you are running an ecommerce business, travel, hospitality, or even blogging, you can only attract consumers to provide them with frictionless experiences. 


## What is SSO
<a href="https://www.loginradius.com/single-sign-on/"><b>Single Sign-On (SSO)</b></a> refers to the authentication process that allows your customers to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials and an active login session.
### SSO - For a seamless user experience
Having SSO for your WordPress sites will boost the experience of the consumer spending time on your site. It is relatively effortless nowadays to build a fancy-looking site that will attract consumers at first. 
But, for a site to gain traction and make those consumers return to your site will be a challenge. 
For example, by offering a frictionless experience and having no barriers like complicated registration forms, asking not to sign in repeatedly will make your site stand out over your competitors. 
SSO helps your consumers navigate across your multiple web properties. Once the user is logged in, they don't have repeated demands for sign-ins. The experience is frictionless.
