# Introduction to SDET

In this in-depth guide, you'll learn all about the role of an SDET. Read on to find out what are the roles and responsibilities and skill set needed for this position.

  

First of all, if you’re wondering what SDET stands for, it’s a software developer engineer in test.

  

An SDET, otherwise known as a Software Development Engineer in Test or Software Design Engineer in Test, takes part equally in software development and testing processes. The SDET mostly works in the IT, gaming, advertising, entertainment, financial, or hospitality sectors and focuses on the testability, robustness, and performance of software development.

## Trends for SDETs

  

First heard of the role of SDET from Microsoft, where I believe it originated.

  

Although I think Microsoft has dropped this title it lives in companies like Amazon and Google and in job postings.

  

You can also see the trend for the number of times the term “SDET” is searched in Google:

With the growth of Agile, DevOps, and Continuous Testing the role of an SDET is on the rise.

  

With more and more companies shifting left in their software development lifecycle, the need to run tests and get quick feedback to the developers is critical.

## Differences between SDET, QA, Tester?

  

Because of these developer-like activities, a software development engineer requires a unique set of skills; someone who has testing skills, understands testing, and can also program.

  

Very often SDET is involved in both white-box and black-box testing—all the way from helping create low-level unit tests to high-level activities like test planning, creating test cases and manual testing.

  

SDETs also have skills that make them perfect resources for creating test automation frameworks and tools. Many times they are part of a development team. They are also the ones that help select what might be the best test automation tools for their teams.

  

Having an SDET as part of your developer's code reviews to make sure this is happening is crucial if you plan on having your developers focus on test-driven development.

## What are the Skills set of an SDET?

An SDET is a Test Automation Engineer of a higher technical level. So, hence he or she is required to have:

  

-   strong coding, design, and analytic skills;
    
-   proficiency in developing automated test systems;
    
-   strong SQL/DB skills;
    
-   experience with common data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems;
    
-   knowledge of backend services and integrations;
    
-   microservice architecture that modern back end is often built upon with its moving parts, dependencies, and interactions;
    
-   understanding of the cloud infrastructure environment.
    

  
  

## What are the responsibilities of a SDET?

They must do everything an automation tester does, plus build testing tools. Below, we’ve listed the key distinct tasks that an SDET is to perform:

-   understand, analyze, and develop complex test data sets;
    
-   build different test scenarios and acceptance tests;
    
-   design and implement automated tests and test environment;
    
-   develop test infrastructure tools for the team on multiple application platforms (web, mobile, and desktop);
    
-   perform low-level testing like unit testing and module testing;
    
-   collaborate with developers, program management, and design teams on technical implementation and user scenarios;
    
-   work with deployment teams to resolve issues in the system.

## SDET tools:

Generally, an SDET uses the same tools as Test Automation Engineers that we described above.

## Other Title of SDET:

The distinction between Test Automation Engineer and SDET may be confusing at first glance. In a classic version, an SDET possesses a more distinct quality mindset and works with the project’s infrastructure designing test automation tools. Meanwhile, a Test Automation Engineer is focused primarily on coding and then quality. He or she automated test cases using off the shelf tools. Still, companies aren’t very strict with the role description.
