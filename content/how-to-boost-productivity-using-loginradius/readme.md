#how to boost productivity using Loginradius

##Introduction
Several tools are utilized by various businesses to increase productivity. These tools provide us with capabilities that allow us to build stand-alone, dynamic, user-friendly applications, as well as to make the application development time and management easier. In this post, we'll be looking at how **loginradius** helps to boost productivity with their features.

##Overview of Loginradius
**LoginRadius** is a cloud-based consumer identity and access management (CIAM) service that enables organizations to provide an exceptional customer experience. It assists organizations in managing users' identities and data in order to provide unified user experiences.

LoginRadius has tools for adding a variety of user authentication options, including email, phone, and social network login authentications like **Google** and **Facebook**. It also assures the security of sensitive data while being easy to adopt across multiple platforms.


##How Loginradius works
By allowing users to choose between multiple integrated authentication methods that are implemented in the application, Loginraduis allows developers to integrate registration and authentication across various platforms of their choice.
When a user selects a method of authentication, a request is sent to loginradius endpoint to verify the user's identity, and a response is delivered to the application once the authentication has been verified.
If you are new to **Loginradius** you can [register](https://www.loginradius.com) a new account and **create a new project**, this will take your **dashboard** where you can set up your applications and have access to all the tools needed to increase productivity.

Loginradius can be used by developers at all levels, from beginners to advanced, who are familiar with one or more programming language.

##The benefits of effective productivity

###Securing user identity
Loginradius enables us to implement user authentication in our applications in a simple and easy-to-use manner across all platforms. Each user can choose their preferred authentication method, such as login using email and password, or login with Facebook, Twitter, or email. Many app users prefer to utilize social network authentication methods since it is safe, quick, and the users don't have to worry about creating a strong password for the app because it’s more secure to use social media login.

###Saving development time
**Loginradius** cuts application development time because you don't have to worry about writing complex code to secure user identity during development; all you have to do is to integrate loginradius authentication **RESTFUL API** on your application, and you're ready to authenticate your user identity.

###Scalability
Loginradius makes applications scalable in the sense that when the frontend experiences performance issues, the users' information saved in loginradius is unaffected because they are segregated using jamstack technology. Loginradius secures user information, this helps in enhancing application productivity.


##How to boost productivity using Loginradius

When it comes to increasing productivity, loginradius has a number of features that can help us do so. Here are a few of them:

###Registration and authentication 
Authenticating user access to apps can be done in a number of ways. By offering a safe means for users to access the application without stress, loginradius authentication offers us all of the tools we needed to boost application productivity.
As long as the method is implemented during the application development, each user has the option of selecting which type of authentication method to use.

This increases productivity by removing the need for a user to remember or use a password in order to use the application; instead, they may simply be authorized via social network authentication or other methods, making your applications more accessible to your users.

###User management
Loginradius has a simple dashboard where you can manage your user information. You may **add users**, **reset user passwords**, **block users**, and **create user roles**, among other things, on the loginradius user **administration page**.

**Setting user roles** allows you to control which actions or resources your users have access to. Loginradius lets you increase productivity by allowing you to regulate what your users have access to with the user management feature.

###Jamstack technology
Loginradius supports **jamstack technology**, which allows developers to utilize a **RESTFUL API** call by integrating user authentication in the application, which  allow dynamic access to user information across several platforms. This help to increases productivity by allowing the application to load faster and improving the user experience. **Jamstack technology** is one of the most recent ways of improving application productivity.

###Cross-Platform Technology
Loginradius allows developers to use any programming language to perform user identity authentication in their application as long as the programming language supports **RESTFUL API**. This tool is very useful because it enables different developers to work on one application using a different programming language, all they have to do is to make a request to loginradius **RESTFUL API** in order to authenticate each user.

###Multi-Medium user access
One of the major benefits of using loginradius is that it allows developers to build applications that enable users authenticated users to access the application across multiple devices like web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications simultaneously. This helps to boost productivity because all the user information is managed in loginradius and each platform communicates with loginradius using **jamstack technology**.



##Some  applications to build using Loginradius

###delivery application
Loginradius can be used to implement user identity authentication in a delivery application, it gives you the opportunity to keep track of users’ information. loginradius has all the tools needed to build an outstanding delivery application authentication.

###Rating app
In building a rating application, where are users can rate a product or service, loginradius can be used to implement user identity authentication on the application

###Survey application
When building a survey application, loginradius can be used to add user authentication methods to the application, which can be done by calling loginradius RESTFUL API. It allows the user to choose their choice of authentication means that are provided by loginradius.

###Ecommerce website
Also, loginradius can be used to implement user authentication and to manage users’ information. It helps to provide more security for the application and it helps to improve services rendered to each of the users, by analyzing the users’ information to make a better decision.

##Conclusion
In this article we discussed how loginradius helps to boost productivity, we look at the overview of loginradius and how loginradius works, alongside some of the benefits of effective productivity and most importantly we look at the features of loginradius that help to boost productivity.

Loginradius is easy to learn and use if you are looking for the best cloud-based consumer identity and access management (CIAM) service for your application in order to boost productivity. you can get started with loginradius by creating a new account.
