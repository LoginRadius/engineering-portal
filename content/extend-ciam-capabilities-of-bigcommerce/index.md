BigCommerce is a great eCommerce platform with rich features, and millions of people benefit from it. But there are limitations when you want to extend the platform for the following identity and access management requirements:

- **Single-sign On (SSO)** to enhance the user experience and improve authentication security
- **Phone login** via mobile number and OTP for quick customer sign-up and sign-in
- **Prefilled customer information** via Social Login for easy checkout
- **Analytics** to learn more about individual customers to boost upsell and cross-sell

Let’s talk about how you can extend BigCommerce and add on the above-mentioned features hassle-free.

The answer is to utilize a **CIAM** (Consumer Identity and Access Management) that provides BigCommerce integration. You can easily configure and implement these features with minimal development effort using the CIAM provider. One such CIAM provider is [LoginRadius](https://accounts.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?return_url=https://dashboard.loginradius.com/login&action=register&plan=pro).

## How to Implement These Features

You are required to create an account with the CIAM provider, enable BigCommerce Integration, and do needed configurations in both BigCommerce and CIAM Provider. For more details, refer to this guide [here](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/guide/big-commerce/).
This guide also explains the modifications required in your Stencil or Blueprint themes of BigCommerce. As a result of this implementation, you can enable the desired authentication method(s) for customers of your BigCommerce Application. Consequently, making the eCommerce experience smoother for your customers.

Both customer and business will see several benefits (described below) from using CIAM solutions for features such as SSO, Phone Login, Prefilled Customer Information, and Analytics.

## Benefits of Implementing These Features

### Enhanced Customer Experience with SSO

SSO lets customers log in with an existing identity. Allowing customers to use their existing identity increases conversions and return rates. It also improves security by allowing your customers to manage lesser digital identities and credentials.
The movement toward Bring Your Own Identity(BYOI) is gaining prominence as customers look to control their digital profiles, and SSO enables customers to bring their own digital identity.

### Increased Customer Engagement with Phone Login

Phone login via OTP allows customers to easily log into their account without remembering a username or password. They only need to provide the Phone Number and then enter the received OTP to log in.

This process makes sign-up and sign-in seamless for the customers and improves customer engagement. Also, businesses get fewer or no forgot password requests from customers, which reduces the support efforts.

### Improved Upsell and Cross-sell with Prefilled Information

The top reason behind the cart abandonment is the long or confusing checkout process. Using the prefilled customer information with the LoginRadius Social Login feature, you can reduce the overall time involved in the checkout process.

Prefilled customer information such as name, city, email address during checkout allows customers to place orders quickly.
Let’s say a customer logged in using a social account and during checkout. With the customer’s permission, LoginRadius can retrieve basic information like name, email, birth date, gender from their social account. Thus, the customers need not enter data manually and experience a shorter and smoother checkout process.

### Insights Turned into Actions

When you use LoginRadius as CIAM, it stores your customer data with your desired data centers. Also, LoginRadius Dashboard allows you to access the customer analytics related to identity, demographics, login, communication, etc. These analytics and charts help you understand your customers and their preferences better.

For example, what is the medium of login your customers are using the most, in which location your products are purchased the maximum times and by which age group, etc.
In addition to the benefits mentioned above, businesses experience some additional benefits explained below.

- You can implement all the above-stated features with minimal development efforts or customizations at your end.
- You get to seamlessly manage any B2B access and communication needed to manage the eCommerce business effortlessly.
