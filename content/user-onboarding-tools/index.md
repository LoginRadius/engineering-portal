![diy-github](diy-github.png)


Onboarding helps to familiarise new users with an interface. There are several different styles of this, and there is no perfect way of doing it. But you can pick up ideas for your work if you study [how onboarding sites](https://speckyboy.com/onboarding-ui-css-javascript/) and apps do.

There is a wide range of tooltip plugins available to assist you in doing that if you have the time, development tools, and the ability to roll up your sleeves and code your user aboard.
