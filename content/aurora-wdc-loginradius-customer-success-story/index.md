Founded in 1995 by Arik Johnson, [Aurora Worldwide Development Corporation (WDC)](https://aurorawdc.com/) is a leading analytics and intelligence firm providing consultative services to corporate clients worldwide. We are grateful to be able to have such a long-standing relationship with Aurora WDC and glad that we have been able to help them in providing a better user experience and a well-rounded solution to better manage their client relationships.

Here, we share the story of Aurora WDC's journey with LoginRadius (with the video down below).

#### **The Situation**

In 2012, Aurora WDC built a social learning platform, Reconverge.net, with the goal of creating a community where their clients are able to connect with each other and learn how to do competitive intelligence work more effectively.

#### **Challenges**

In order to build an effective social learning platform and attract members to become a part of this community, there were a few hurdles that Aurora WDC needed to overcome:

- Simplify the login and authentication process
- The solution needs to be compatible with and implemented on their WordPress websites
- Need to integrate the user data with other systems, namely Salesforce and Pardot
- Eventually transitioned to Hubspot - need to re-integrate with the new system

#### **LoginRadius Solutions**

When Aurora WDC approached LoginRadius with said challenges, we gracefully accepted and proceeded to tackle every single one of them. First and foremost, [our social login feature](https://www.loginradius.com/social-login/) allowed them to provide social login options for their users, which resulted in a quick and easy registration and authentication process.

Users no longer had to experience the hassle of entering in their personal details or come up with yet another password, and can simply select and login with their preferred social provider.

In addition, LoginRadius' comprehensive WordPress plugin ensured that there were no issues when implementing this solution on Aurora WDC's WordPress-based sites.

One of the main strengths of LoginRadius [customer identity and access management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/06/customer-identity-and-access-management/) platform is its flexibility to integrate with multiple systems and tools that our customers are using to help enhance their workflows.

In this case, we were able to successfully integrate Aurora WDC's LoginRadius account and user data with both Salesforce and Pardot so they can have a clear view of their clients and manage those relationships, as well as maximize their marketing efforts based on the user data collected via LoginRadius.

As Aurora WDC transitioned to Hubspot, we stepped up our game and re-integrated them with Hubspot to make sure that there is no interruption as they continue to build their client relationships.
