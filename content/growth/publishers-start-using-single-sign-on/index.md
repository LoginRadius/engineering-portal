## Introduction

Publishers—you know first party data is important. You know that it can help you better understand your users and their behaviors, and provide you with the information you need to make smarter decisions about how to serve them.

But collecting first party data isn't easy—especially if you're running a subscription-based business model. You have to decide between paywalls or subscriptions, or maybe even try both! And then there's the headache of managing all those different platforms on top of everything else you're already doing.

What if there was another way? What if there was a way to collect first party data that didn't require any new software or additional work?

That's where [single sign-on](https://www.loginradius.com/single-sign-on/) technology comes in. Single sign-on allows publishers to seamlessly integrate their existing subscription services into one platform so they can collect first party data without having to worry about anything else!


## How SSO Helps Publishers? 

Single sign-on can add to a positive reader experience in a couple of ways:


### 1. Collect better quality data for analytics and audience insights

[SSO can help publishers](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/benefits-single-sign-on-sso/) collect more and better quality data. As readers go through the sign-in process, they’re providing publishers with information that can be used to better understand their habits and preferences and improve their experience. 

This is especially important as publishers move towards combining revenue streams from advertising and subscriptions—SSO tech helps advertisers better understand what readers are looking for, which in turn makes ads more relevant. This helps publishers retain loyal readers who value having access to personalized content and ads.


### 2. Reduce cost and increase revenue

SSO increases revenue by reducing the number of times a user has to log in. A single sign-on solution that allows users to enter their credentials once and then access all the publisher's sites with the same login information.

It also minimizes cost by reducing manual labor involved in creating accounts for new users or resetting passwords, as well as the costs associated with data breaches when password databases are stolen.


### 3. Protect reader data from being shared without permission

Publishers who rely on third-party companies for ad delivery and other services have historically been vulnerable to [breaches of privacy](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/how-to-handle-data-breaches/) due to the nature of those relationships. 

With single sign-on, there’s no need for third parties by design; everything happens within your own domain or app so that your readers stay safe from hackers and scammers looking for personal data like email addresses or credit card numbers.


### 4. Add value through personalization

The ability to track user behavior across multiple platforms allows publishers to offer customized content and advertising that is relevant to each individual reader's interests. This helps publishers retain loyal readers who value having access to personalized content and ads.
