## What is Brand Recognizability?

Brands are constantly competing to stand out and attract larger clientele. Marketers and advertisers develop new strategies to increase brands' visibility and make them recognizable.

Today, it is extremely easy to promote brands and [sell products on different online platforms](https://zyro.com/blog/best-things-sell-online/), but the problem lies in uniqueness and the possibility of staying in people’s memory.

  

We find a plethora of brand promotions on social media, news, YouTube videos, films, but sometimes they are annoying. Thus, instead of getting interested in a brand, our brain creates negative associations with it, especially when the product or service is too strange and unnecessary for us.

Therefore, [brand promotions](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/top-5-marketing-strategies-to-power-up-your-business/) should be targeted at specific groups of consumers, taking into account not only their needs and preferences but something more sophisticated - their identities.

## Consumer Identity Importance

The things we buy help us to better express who we are. Sounds fantastic, isn’t it? But <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/communications/journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/153/2017/06/01IlawEJFall14.pdf">many researchers</a> in the field of marketing and psychology prove the credibility of this connection between self-and product-image.

Consumers try to express their internal feelings with external means such as brands. We can conclude that purchase is the form of self-expression, and brand is the symbol of our inner self.
