![List Your Business For Free At Top Citation Sites of Canada 2017!]Last month while planning one of my family event, I Googled for a great event management organization but contrary to my belief, the company that I settled myself with, was missing from the search engine result page which surprised me that how can such an awesome company is being avoided by the search engine giant! After doing some analysis I came to know that the reason behind this is the absence of the business from local search engine directories.

All this thing left me with a curiosity and I typed my own business name on search engines. And what I found? My website is also missing there. This gave me a hard shock and I started finding out the ways that can make my web property visible on the search engines. After researching a lot I stumbled upon the “citation” or "business listing" technique. It is something with which you can list your business along with so many other businesses of your relevant niche and reach out for quality audience.

## **Now the question is “What is Citation?”**

The citation is a process or you can say it is a mention of your business along with some details like your address, contact details, websites, etc. so that people can easily find you on the internet when they are searching for similar services and products that you are offering. Local Citation also known as business listing not only helps your business to reach out to people but also boosts up search engine ranking of your business website. But one should always keep in mind that the websites that are choosing being chosen for citation must be of high-quality.

### **Benefits of Citation:**

- It help customers to find businesses and services that they are looking for.
- It is one of the key factors of the ranking algorithm for major search engines.
- It boosts Local SEO.

### **Ingredients Needed For Citation:**

- Registered email account.
- Proper Business address.
- Zip Code
- Contact Details including phone number and business email.
- Contact Person Details
- Business keywords
- Business category
- Business Description
