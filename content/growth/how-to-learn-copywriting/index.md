But let's address the elephant in the room: the days of increasing your website traffic just by writing [SEO-optimized content](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/03/how-to-drive-in-the-highest-quality-leads-in-2021-with-content-and-seo/) are over.

  

Studies show that users are more likely to be responsive to content that inspires an emotional reaction. That's why your current SEO strategy isn't working. You can get site visitors, but you aren't keeping them there for the long term.

  

Today, everyone knows how to write optimized web copy and content. This calls for marketing copywriters to push the bar higher in making readers love your content.

  

In this blog, we have put together the most effective hacks that will help you write irresistible copy that evokes a strong response from readers.

### 1. There are plenty of proven methods - Use Them!

  

Does copywriting come naturally to you? Don't worry if it doesn't. There are special tricks you can learn to publish your first "unputdownable" article.

  

One such technique used by most copywriting firms is the “4P writing formula.”

  

The 4Ps of marketing is a tried and tested copywriting formula that ensures the highest return on investment. The 4Ps stand for Promise, Picture, Proof, and Pitch.

  

Every business is unique in some way, and knowing what you’re doing is the key to getting the attention and [attract of your prospective customers](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/02/attract-consumers-to-your-website/). If they understand what you do and how you can help them, then these prospects are much more likely to become clients.

  

The 4P copywriting formula entails four steps. Let’s understand each of them separately.

  

### a. Promise

  

The highlight of your content is the promise it makes. It should express how the product can benefit your consumer. In other words, "promise" allows users to see how their lives can change as a result of using the product. You can put the promise in the headline of your article too.

  

### b. Picture

  

Next, you need to paint a picture in the prospect's mind. But remember that you are not trying to prove a point. So, don't use facts and figures.

  

Instead, you may use emotive to attract your prospect's attention. According to a Harvard professor, [95% of purchasing decisions are made subconsciously](https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html).

  

So, take a good look at the words you use in your copy. Are they designed to make people feel a certain way? Don't think of them as just words; think of them as business tools.

  

### c. Proof

  

Almost every buyer thinks of the following questions while purchasing a product:

  

-   How should I justify my purchase?
    
-   How should I defend my purchase when people ask me questions about it?
    
-   What should I do if the product doesn't work for me?
    
-   What would I do if the company turns out to be a fraudster?
    

  

There is nothing more effective than providing proof to show that your product is effective. Maybe an ebook, a case study, a whitepaper, or user testimonials will be best. You should leave that decision up to your copywriters.

  

### d. Pitch

  

Now that they know how great your product is, it's time to ask them to invest in it. However, it won't happen by adding a simple "Call to Action" button. You need to provide a compelling reason.

  

In this stage, you can talk about discounts, guarantees, limited time offers, or other free bonuses that customers might enjoy if they purchase your product.

### 2. Train your copywriters to use a powerful language

  

The presentation of words on the page is just as important as what they say.

  

Have you read articles that you cannot put down until you finish reading them? What do you think is the primary reason behind it?

  

Those writers that we enjoy reading are masters at crafting engaging content. They use specific words to make us want to keep reading and know how to encourage the reader to take action.

  

Do you know that [7.5 million blog posts](https://letter.ly/how-many-blog-posts-are-published-per-day/#:~:text=7.5%20million%20blog%20posts%20are%20published%20every%20day.&text=You%20see%2C%20the%20vast%20majority,blogging%20habits%20of%20individual%20bloggers.) are published every day? So, if you want your article to stand out amongst the rest, you cannot only depend on SEO copywriting guidelines. Instead, you must learn how to write engaging content.

  

Using "Power Words" is a highly beneficial technique that can help copywriters [attract consumers to their website](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/02/attract-consumers-to-your-website/).

  

There are 7 different categories of power words:

  

-   Fear Power Words: Agony, Apocalypse, Beware, Catastrophe, Caution, Prison, etc.
    
-   Encouragement Power Words: Mind-blowing, Breathtaking, Spectacular, Grateful, etc.
    
-   Lust Power Words: Naughty, Pleasure, Desire, Seduce, Enchant, Tempting, Thrilling, etc.
    
-   Anger Power Words: Nasty, Arrogant, Pissed off, Clown, Disgusting, Dishonest, etc.
    
-   Greed Power Words: Lowest price, Jackpot, Cheap, Pay zero, Extra, Don’t miss out, etc.
    
-   Safety Power Words: Privacy, Certified, Cancel anytime, Risk-free, Moneyback, etc.
    
-   Forbidden Power Words: Ancient, Sealed, Censored, Remote, Ssshhh!!!, Myths, etc.
    

### 3. Use the right tools to write flawlessly and pack a punch

  

Many people underestimate the importance of proofreading their documents if they have already followed all the writing rules. The right tone will ensure that website visitors have a great experience browsing through the content.

  

You can also count on tools like Grammarly to deliver results with its detailed analysis and error-checking capabilities. That said, copywriters generally make the following mistakes:

  

-   Passive Voice
    
-   Adverbs
    
-   Contextual mishaps
    
-   Readability
    

  

The Hemingway app is also a quite helpful tool that goes beyond the initial spell-check and shows detailed results on how to fix passive voice and improve sentence structure.

  

A Bonus Tip: Your customers are busy. They don’t have time to read long-form copy. Keep your content brief and drive your messaging home with a few strategic words or phrases. The mantra is KISS, which stands for Keep It Short and Simple. You need to get to the point quickly.

## Conclusion

Remember that SEO-optimized content is essential to rank your blogs or website pages on search engines. But even more important is to hold the user's attention once they begin to read your content.

  

To develop a unique [brand identity](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/04/does-your-website-imagery-reflect-your-brand-identity/), you need to have a team of top-notch copywriters who can keep the readers glued to the content and eventually help increase your business.
