## Introduction

Admit it, we’ve all witnessed a paradigm shift amid the global pandemic, and the entire entertainment industry is now transformed forever. 

The way broadcasters distribute the content over the OTT (over-the-top) platforms has replaced the conventional movie theaters and created a massive opportunity for small and mid-sized production companies to reach global audiences. 

However, the sudden increase in OTT users has also increased the security challenges, and many OTT platforms witnessed massive identity thefts.

On the other hand, a big challenge is increasing subscribers and ensuring that only subscribers with paid subscriptions have access to the content and not just anyone. 

Adding a stringent authentication mechanism through a CIAM solution that ensures robust security and enhances user experience is the need of the hour for every OTT platform. 

Here’s where the role of OTT authentication comes into play! 

Let’s understand the aspects of incorporating OTT authentication for OTT platforms and why it’s crucial from a lead generation perspective. 


## What is OTT Authentication? Why Do You Need it? 

Authentication is the process of identifying users/subscribers and validating who they claim to be.

One of the most common and apparent factors to authenticate identity is a password. If the user name matches the password credential, the identity is valid, and the system grants access to the user.

However, standard password authentication will not work for OTT platforms since the subscribers may share the same credentials with their friends, and multiple people would be enjoying a single subscription. 

Here’s where [OTT authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/ott-simplify-authentication/) through a consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution becomes crucial. 

A cutting-edge CIAM solution like LoginRadius incorporates multi-factor authentication (MFA) and adaptive authentication that shuns any chance of identity theft and misuse. 

Also, the authentication mechanism incorporates access management that helps improve user experience and eventually plays a crucial role in enhancing overall data and privacy security.

[LoginRadius’ cloud-based CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/) solution helps businesses seamlessly manage access without hampering the overall user experience. This allows OTT platforms to gain more signups, increase retention rates, and scale business growth.

Interestingly, with enterprises going passwordless, many use modern authentication techniques like one-time passcodes (OTP) via SMS, or email, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometrics, etc. authenticate users and deploy security beyond what passwords usually provide.


## How CIAM Fosters Lead Generation for OTT Platforms? 

In a digitally advanced modern world where competition in the media industry is neck-to-neck, a little friction in the overall registration process could compel users to switch. 

Yes, every user expects a great experience and a seamless registration process that doesn’t annoy them. 

In a nutshell, if an OTT platform isn’t offering a [flawless registration experience](https://www.loginradius.com/authentication/), it’s losing business. 

A CIAM solution is more than just an identity management system; it helps businesses improve lead generation, enhance conversions, and deliver a seamless user experience when a user first interacts with the brand. 

Users always consider platforms offering smooth sign-ups rather than asking them to fill lengthy registration forms. 

Whether it’s social login or OTP registration, a CIAM solution always helps deliver a seamless experience that helps improve lead generation and conversion rates. 


## Advantages of OTT Authentication through a CIAM

Consumer identity and access management solutions are helping different OTT leaders derive growth by offering top-class user experiences coupled with robust security. Here’s the list of advantages that you get with OTT authentication through a CIAM: 


### Single Sign-On (SSO): For a seamless experience

Single Sign-On allows your customers to access any of your web properties, mobile apps, and third-party systems with a single identity. 

OTT users perceive your enterprise as a single entity, and they expect you to treat them like a single customer.

If you have multiple websites and mobile apps under the same company umbrella, there’s no reason you can’t meet this expectation.

Web SSO authentication from LoginRadius brings everything together. Each customer has one account. They can use one set of credentials anywhere they interact with your brand.

### Access Management: For Restricting Content

With the increasing access to media over OTT platforms, the OTT industry’s biggest challenge is setting age restrictions for specific content.

While most media platforms aren’t focusing on creating sub-profiles, the competitors are already leveraging access management for a single identity used by multiple users.

Whether we talk about a particular category of content for premium users or setting age restrictions, access management plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience for every business.

Access management through a CIAM solution like LoginRadius helps improve user experience and eventually plays a crucial role in enhancing overall data and privacy security.


### Social Login: For instant and easy registration

As discussed earlier, a little friction in the overall registration process could be the reason for a user’s switch. Hence, social login is the ultimate solution to help speed up the process. 

[Social login](https://www.loginradius.com/social-login/), also termed social sign-in or social sign-on, allows your consumers to login and register with a single click on a website or mobile application using their existing accounts from various social providers.


## The Bottom Line

The rising popularity of OTT platforms and soaring numbers of subscribers depict that the future belongs to online content distribution platforms. 

However, the associated risks with these OTT platforms can’t be overlooked. Businesses shouldn’t ignore the importance of secure and seamless authentication that streamlines lead generation and overall business growth. 

A cutting-edge CIAM solution like LoginRadius can help OTT platforms deliver a frictionless user experience backed with stringent security.
