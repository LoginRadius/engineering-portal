Creating a frictionless consumer experience should be the top priority of every business striving for success in the digital world.

A [survey by Accenture Interactive](https://www.accenture.com/t20180503T034117Z__w__/nl-en/_acnmedia/PDF-77/Accenture-Pulse-Survey.pdf) found that 48% of consumers have switched from one website to another just because the former lacked personalization—and, the trend is swiftly increasing.

But how online service providers ensure they have maximum sign-ups and eventually have more conversions? Or in other words, what’s the [biggest secret to winning consumer trust](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-security/) right from the moment a user first visits the website?

Today, enterprises must be aware that the secret to success lies in quickly identifying and eliminating any troubles and pain points that occur when consumers interact with their organization (whether through website or application).

Don’t worry, you need not do everything yourself!

A user identity management solution like LoginRadius does everything, literally everything for you.

Let’s learn how [LoginRadius CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/) (consumer identity and access management) solution offers a frictionless consumer journey right from the beginning and ensures maximum conversions.

## Every Consumer Interaction is a Delightful Interaction with LoginRadius

Businesses need to pay close attention to consumer experience, the total of digital and in-person interactions that a user has with a brand.

At baseline, a good consumer experience needs to work to deliver products and services with minimal fuss.

And if a company wants to pull out and stay ahead of the curve, that experience needs to be remarkable. Integrated. Personal. Delightful.

LoginRadius guarantees the same!

Since users already know what defines a delightful experience as they are already interacting with brands like Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, businesses must ensure they’re trying to achieve a similar grade. Failing which, users will quickly switch brands.

Here’s how we achieve this:

-   Designing the Ideal Consumer Journey
    

From the first [step of user onboarding](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/user-onboarding-revamp-application/) to the thousandth login, create a process that is welcoming and intelligent to foster great consumer relationships.

-   Localization-To Build Trust
    

LoginRadius supports every human language, so all of your forms, email messages, and texts can be customized for your worldwide market.

-   Tailor-Make your Interfaces
    

Choose the fields and design your registration, login, and forgot password forms. Everything can be white-labeled, so consumers won’t know you’re using LoginRadius.

-   An Email Workflow that Actually Works
    

Whenever you need to get into your consumer’s inbox to manage the login process, LoginRadius provides customizable templates and sequences so you’re always on-brand.

-   Deliver a High-Performance Experience
    

Never turn a consumer away because your login service is down. LoginRadius has unmatched uptime, and we can handle 150K logins per second—that’s “20x More than Our Competitors”.

-   Unify The Login Process With Single Sign-On.
    

Easily connect your websites, mobile apps, and third-party services so that consumers can interact with you everywhere using a single identity.

-   Effective Consumer Experience that Drives Growth
    

Since users remember negative experiences more than positive ones, businesses must ensure they deliver the finest user experience.

If your brand can identify the key problem areas that users face and are able to deliver a rich consumer-centric experience, you’re automatically ahead of your competitors.

LoginRadius understands the importance of a rich consumer experience throughout the onboarding journey of a user that later converts into a buyer.

Here’s what businesses can achieve by getting LoginRadius user onboarding system

-   Increase Upselling and Cross-Selling
    

Bring in more revenue with a personalized experience. When you know people’s preferences, you can offer what they want, when they want it, the way they want it.
