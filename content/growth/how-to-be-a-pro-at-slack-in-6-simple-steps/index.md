Team communication has always been a matter of concern for many of the employers. The major challenge is to keep all communication in one place while not affecting the productivity. This also gets very crucial if there are remote teams involved. 

### **Slack is the answer**

Disclaimer: Slack fanboy here. But it was not as the same before. I first heard about slack when it was being implemented at LoginRadius. Been using skype, hangouts in past for team communication, I was quite skeptical. But after using slack for an year, I must say that not only, it is one of the best tools for team communication but also it takes productivity to a whole _wow_ level.

### **Why Choose Slack over Skype, Hangout or others?**

There are enough reasons of why one should choose Slack over other communication tools.

- You can easily communicate with your teams using Slack’s internal channels.
- Slack is more secured as a technology for your organization than Skype or Hangout because only your team members are allowed to join your Slack team. It discourages outsiders to join.
- You can easily integrate your favorite apps with Slack. Slack has a huge directory of apps which can be integrated.
- You need to check unread messages on all your devices on Skype. This doesn’t happen with Slack. Moreover, Slack does not drain your mobile’s battery life unlike Skype and Hangout.

So, for people who are still struggling with Slack at their workplace, this article is going to help them to pick up some tips and tricks which can make them a real pro at Slack in 6 simple steps. Go ahead with the list:-

### **Works on browser and app both, YAY!**

Well, there are two ways to access Slack: via browser and via app. But, everything gets faster and automatic with Slack desktop app.

![Slack on browser and app]( Slack-on-browser-and-app.png?ver=1553881376)

[**Source**](https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2015/03/slack-windows.png?ver=1553881376?itok=aTD2os-J)

Slack app launches itself automatically by default every time you start your system. Thus, no need to open your browsers to use Slack from now.

### **Give your touch to Slack app**

Foremostly, explore Slack. Leave your mark on your desktop app by uploading your profile picture. Also, ensure that your job title, name and username are set. It is very important to mark your online presence when face to face meetings and phone calls are being replaced by digital communication. Co-workers will recognize “_your name_” much easier than any “synonymical name”.

Also do not forget to pick your favorite theme for your Slack app.

- Click on your **_profile name_** at top left corner of Slack window.
- Click on **_preferences_**. A new tab opens up which shows preferences with your team name.
- Click on **_sidebar theme._**
- Select your various themes from the list.

_**Note**:- You can even customize your own theme and enjoy sharing it with others. The option is available on the same page._

### **Create/choose your channels**

Feel free to create your channels (_all members can do_ [_that_](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel)) on your Slack. And if you feel a channel remains unused, you can always delete it (_team owners and admins can do_ [_that_](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/213185307-Delete-a-channel)). Now, a wise way to create channels will be creating it according to teams (team-oriented updates) and locations (for location-oriented updates). Also, provide a channel for newsroom (general updates). Besides this, Slack starts off with common channels like **_#general_** and **_#random_**. Everyone is automatically added to **_#general_** as soon as he or she joins the team. Hence, **_#general_** can be used for important announcements for everyone. **_#random_** is created for random conversations (_well, that’s obvious_).

Well, now coming to joining/choosing channels, you can join any channel that seems relevant to you and you can control your notifications for those channels in Slack. Want to know how? Keep reading.

- Mark a star to the channels in which you _interact the most_ so that they can appear at the top of your sidebar list.
- You can also select ‘show any kind of activity’ for your favorite channel while you can select to show notifications only if it has your mention or highlighted words.  Let’s see how to do it!
    - **Step 1:** Go to your channel’s **_notification preferences_** through settings (gear icon on top right corner).
    - **Step 2:** Select “mention of my name or highlights” for getting notifications related to your name or highlighted words.

**Note:** _You can mute a channel through “mute this channel” option. Moreover, you can clear all unread messages through **SHIFT + ESC.**_

### **Use of “Highlight word” notification**

Slack will notify you whenever your name is included in a message but if you want it to notify you some highlighted phrases and words, you can do it through **_notification_** settings.

**Method**

- [Click](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201398467-Highlight-word-notifications) your **_team name_** at the top left corner.
- Select **_preferences._**
- Click **_notifications_** tab.
- Fill the **_highlight words_** box with your choice of highlighted phrases or words.
