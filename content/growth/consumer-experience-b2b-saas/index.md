Last five years have witnessed a sudden influx of marketing practices, sales processes, and data teams in enterprise-level B2B SaaS companies. They have been investing in consumer data to enhance purchasersâ€™ journey or amplify their pre-sales process. 

It shouldn't come as a surprise that they are acknowledging the need to provide a full view of their accounts (including branches and divisions), global account addresses, consumer contacts, and sales and marketing performance prospects.

Consumer experience assessment and development is not only acceptable for consumers; it is good for the company. An emphasis on CX produces a competitive advantage that drives consumer retention, sales growth, and company valuation over time.

With the right business growth, technology, and training, you allow your support agents to tackle even the biggest product problems and provide your [consumers with excellent and reliable service](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-experience-solutions/). 

Here are five ways to motivate your B2B SaaS consumer support team to deliver outstanding experiences:


## #1. Create impactful touchpoints for clients.

Consumers retain a brand based on their experiences through touchpoints, interactions, and engagements. As a business, this allows you to ensure that you have a strategic and satisfying mechanism. You need to use efficient, optimistic brand marketing and a smooth way to connect with the brand.

Therefore, ensure that your communication is valuable, smooth, and promising to your consumers. Enhancing the B2B consumer experience will eventually create faith and trust in them for the brand.


## #2. Know their market concerns and difficulties.

When you have so much information to pursue your consumers to purchase a product, you may sometimes confuse them with overwhelming information. 

So, here's what you need to do. Start by being all ears to your clients, their business issues, and concerns they are trying to eradicate with a solution. 

Be a polite listener, ask all the right questions, and explain your concerns about their business issues. Also, take time to learn about their strengths, appreciate their development and growth, and get the hang of their rivals. Assure them that you are here to solve their issues.  


## #3. Concentrate on market values to fulfill their KPIs.

Speak to them about the business principles they would anticipate from using your product/solution at any stage when engaging with your clients. Do less bragging about your product's functionality and strengths and do more talking about what market advantages and values will drive for clients.

In reality, companies should organize their teams to facilitate and carry out substantive consumer discussions about adding value to their businesses. It includes pre-sales, post-sales, marketing, and consumer/technology support.
