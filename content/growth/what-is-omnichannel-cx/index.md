Consumer requirements are constantly shifting, and companies must evolve with digital transformation to identify their needs and aspirations. No wonder, consumer experience is increasingly becoming a determinant in the decision-making process.

  

According to Google, [71%](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/how-digital-connects-shoppers-to-local-stores/amp/) of people believe that smartphones have become an essential part of their digital experience. The importance of omnichannel consumer experience  (CX) in helping companies get valuable insights about consumer interactions and behavior across their life cycle cannot be overstated.

  

Based on research conducted by Aberdeen Group, [89%](https://www.aberdeen.com/cmo-essentials/omni-channel-and-the-future-of-customer-experience/) of consumers are retained by the best omnichannel consumer strategy.

  

Now, the question comes: how should businesses plan their strategy to offer an enhanced omnichannel consumer experience?

  

Before getting into implementation, it is essential to know what it is, why it is required, along with its benefits. So, let's get started.

  

## What is Omnichannel Consumer Experience (CX)

  

[Omnichannel consumer experience](https://www.loginradius.com/resource/making-customers-feel-seen-in-an-omnichannel-world/) (CX) involves simplifying all consumer interactions across various touchpoints in a cohesive manner. As per a study,  [9 out of 10](https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-centre/delivering-an-excellent-omni-channel-experience/) consumers expect an omnichannel experience with seamless service across all communication channels.

  

For sales, consumer service, and marketing, a digital omnichannel strategy adopts a multichannel approach. It focuses on providing a united consumer experience regardless of the channel they contact your company.

  

Every contact should be considered a single experience from the consumer's perspective. It implies it shouldn't be segregated or repetitious. The key to providing constant omnichannel engagement is to offer a smooth experience across all platforms, both online and offline.

  

## Omnichannel Marketing and Consumer Experience: What's the Difference

  

It's important to note that omnichannel marketing and consumer experience  differ from each other at a significant scale.

  

Omnichannel marketing is communicating with consumers through digital and conventional marketing channels that are interconnected. For example, a consumer may get promotional SMS offers while buying in-store. They may get abandoned cart emails and retargeting advertisements on Facebook if they leave a product online.

  

On the other hand, an omnichannel experience comprises a multichannel approach to sales, consumer service, and marketing. It necessitates delivering a consistent consumer experience regardless of the channel via which consumers interact with your business.

  

Companies that want to create an omnichannel experience must ensure their marketing goals, objectives, messages, and design are consistent across all channels. A company's marketing, consumer service, and user experience may all be improved by combining these elements.

## Significance of Omnichannel Consumer Experience (CX) for Your Business

An efficient and well-designed omnichannel platform yields an excellent consumer experience as a by-product. To accomplish that, businesses must understand consumer journeys over devices and channels.

  

Here are some of the most compelling reasons to switch to an omnichannel consumer experience platform.

### 1. Improved insight of the consumer journey

An omnichannel consumer experience strategy provides you with a bird's-eye perspective of your consumers' journey. It brings all of your interactions together in one platform and gives you insights into improving your business.

  

### 2. Enhanced consumer retention

An omnichannel CX strategy allows consumers to engage with the business through their chosen channels while maintaining a seamless transition throughout the interaction. As a result, it improves consumer satisfaction and is the most effective approach for client retention.

### 3. Increased CLTV (Consumer Lifetime Value)

Over their lifetime, omnichannel consumers are [30%](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P16276) more beneficial for your business. Using an omnichannel CX strategy makes contacting the business easy and simple. When a company commits to providing a consistent service, they also commit to working with consumers for the rest of their lives.

## Benefits of Omnichannel Consumer Experience (CX)

Transforming your company into an omnichannel consumer experience platform would provide several advantages, including the following:

### 1. Rising consumer loyalty

Consumers become loyal consumers when they get high-quality service before and after the purchase. You can demonstrate that you understand their requirements by evaluating the gathered consumer data and displaying relevant offers.

### 2. Elevated sales

It is known that using several entry points improves the likelihood that a consumer would select your brand; thereby, implementing an omnichannel strategy can boost sales.

### 3. Superior level of consumer service

Delivering omnichannel consumer support goes hand in hand with omnichannel consumer experience. Due to the use of numerous channels for monitoring, consumer support executives can miss a chat from some other desk, resulting in a significant chance of losing a prospective client. Implementing an omnichannel strategy will allow you to have all of your consumers' data in one place, allowing you to offer superior service.
