Every writer, amateur or professional, needs to pick up new ways to expand their writing techniques and create elite contents. Well, there are many ingredients which you will need to serve the best content to your cult and this demands some _extra_ help. So, if you are looking for some best writing tools which can improve your blog posts, then lucky you. Here is a list of some essential online writing tools for you which can help you to improve your articles.

Word processors can only help you to generate words on the page but generating a valuable content is a complex job yet it can be much simpler if you have got the right tools to help you. Whether you are a first timer in using writing software for a content generation or a pro trying the best writers’ instruments in the market, the article is worth your attention. But before moving ahead, we need to discuss what sort of help does a writer needs from his software.

### **What should you check in software for writers?**

Your tools do not need to invent the wheel. They just require refining your content. So, don’t go frenzy over an extensive list of technical specifications and features. You should always choose a software which suits your style of writing. Because those features will seldom matter if you do not use them.

Here, I have classified the necessary attributes of the software in three categories:-

**Readily Usable**

Any user loves an easy to use software. Even though every writing software is specialized for creative writing, writers will feel much relaxed if their software which is easy to use.

**Advanced Features to edit your work**

Editing is a very necessary process of content generation, and there is a huge difference between ‘being grammatically incorrect’ and your articles being ready to be published. Word processors can correct you when you are grammatically incorrect, but only a writing software can tell you about the use of recurring phrases, over-description, and passive verbs.

When it comes to creative writing, you need to have a keener outlook at your articles, or you may lose your readers.

**Some Additional Features**

Choosing extra features depends on your writing style as each and every feature will not apply to you. Features may include a word thesaurus, a twist generator or a character creator. Again, don’t be confused over features. Be aware of your requirements and then choose the product.

Now, here are some tools according to various categories every writer should use:-

### **Title generator tools**
