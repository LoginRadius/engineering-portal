This article is a part of our Business listing series. Visit List of_ _[US Citation Sites](https://loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2017/02/business-listing-citation-sites-usa/) ._

I am happy to share that since we submitted our business to US and Canadian business listing sites, there is a tremendous increase in the number of leads we are getting. This made me compile a list of citation sites based in Australia. I have checked all these Australian citation sites by doing a submission on each of them. I have also mentioned the steps to submit on each site.

Listing your business to citation sites can be very helpful not only for lead generation but it also helps getting your brand recognized locally. So, if you are a local business who wants to focus on a specific locality, submit your website to these business listing sites and see the difference.

If you want to know more on what is citation refer [this](https://loginradius.com/blog/fuel/top-25-citation-sites-canada/) article.
