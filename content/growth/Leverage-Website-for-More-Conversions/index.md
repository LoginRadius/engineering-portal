Your website is perhaps the most crucial entity that can leave an impression on your audience. The way it portrays your brand defines whether you’ll have a client or just another visitor.

Your visitors may take action, but most of the time, they don’t. While many of them just ignore your subscription requests, some of them manage to share their details.

The biggest challenge for businesses is not just to increase traffic but to convert the existing ones in a way that they become a client.

Here’s where [conversion rate optimization](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2021/01/sign-up-tips-conversion-rate/) (CRO) comes into play.

CRO is perhaps the most important performance metric for any business seeking substantial growth in today’s era.

Though driving conversions isn’t a piece of cake, it largely depends on the way your website is conveying a message and building credibility in the first couple of seconds when the visitor lands.

Here we’ve clubbed some crucial aspects that will help your business enhance conversion rate through correct utilization of your website in this ever-increasing competitive world.

<b>1. Mobile Optimization</b>

You’ve probably heard that mobile optimization is the key to enhance sales and improve conversions, but how you surprise your visitors changes the entire game.

Optimizing your website for diverse mobile platforms, devices, and web browsers pave a path for a rich user experience, which in turn helps you to enhance conversions.

To be honest, would you prefer shopping from an [eCommerce](https://www.loginradius.com/industry-retail-and-ecommerce/) store where you have to pinch on your smartphone every now & then to find what you’re looking for? Probably no, isn’t it?

When a website delivers an optimized layout as per the screen size of a device with seamless navigation, a user can be quickly converted and you can expect them to inch towards the next step.

<b>2. Enhance Page Loading Time</b>

A website that doesn’t load quickly is good for nothing. Yes, everyone is expecting a quick response on the internet and they always strive to consider a website that loads fast.

Admit it, everyone is offering almost similar kinds of services.

Be it your competitors or a new player in the market, the ones offering a flawless user experience, especially when it comes to loading speed, will stay ahead of the curve.

Your website should be optimized in a way that it doesn’t take more than 4-5 seconds to load. Moreover, rigorously testing post optimization is the right way to ensure your audience isn’t waiting for the landing page to load.

<b>3. Optimize Call-to-Action Buttons</b>

Call to action (CTA) buttons and [effective signup forms](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2017/04/sign-up-forms-best-practices/) play a crucial role in improving conversions. Adding a CTA randomly without an adequate marketing strategy in place is of no use.

Most businesses and marketers ignore the importance of a call to action when it comes to increasing conversions and generating more revenues.

A well-designed and well-placed effective CTA can enhance the numbers when it comes to conversions. But how do know about the best place to add CTA?

Well, you need to understand the user persona of your targeted audience and figure out the actual problems that they’re facing and how your solution solves the purpose.

Based on this data, you can add a CTA to your website. For instance, any software development company could provide a brief about their product, its ability to solve a complex problem, and then put a CTA - “book a free demo.”

<b>4. Analyze Visitor Data</b>

Consumers these days are always on the hunt for a seamless and consistent experience that can be delivered through an [omnichannel consumer experience.](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/fuel/2020/04/omnichannel-customer-experience/)

Businesses need to quickly work on user behaviour and invest in omnichannel experience across their platform so that users are catered to the best experience ever.

<b>5. Reviews & Testimonials for Building Credibility</b>

Adding a bunch of reviews and testimonials to your landing page is yet another great way to build trust in your targeted audience.

People prefer established brands, especially the ones that are trusted by other brands.

Adding a couple of [reviews and testimonials](https://www.loginradius.com/customers/) of happy clients can significantly boost your conversion rate and would surely unfold different opportunities.
