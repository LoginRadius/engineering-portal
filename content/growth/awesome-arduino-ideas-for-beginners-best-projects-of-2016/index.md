My first encounter with Arduino was at a friend’s place who was using it for home automation. I really liked the idea of switching off the lights and Fan automatically when he leaves the room. Sound like some sci fi, right?

Later I researched a lot on Arduino and made some simple projects. My love for Arduino still continues. To that end, I have compiled a list of some awesome Arduino ideas for Beginners. I have also added the best Arduino projects of 2016 which can inspire the Nerd inside you!

### **1\. Dancing LED Cube**

This Arduino project is my favorite one. It looks overwhelming at once but is very easy to create. If you think 8\*8\*8 version is too big, try 4\*4\*4 one. You can add a timer or alarm to it to play it at specific times or just keep it running in your room for that disc like feel.

<script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">var player; function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() { player = new YT.Player('player', { videoId: '6mXM-oGggrM', playerVars: { controls: 0, autoplay: 0, disablekb: 1, enablejsapi: 1, iv_load_policy: 3, modestbranding: 1, showinfo: 0, rel: 0 } }); }</script>

### **2\. Motion Detector Alarm**

This is nice little Project Idea which can detect motion and play the alarm. You can use this for anything related like switching on the lights or playing a song when you enter home.
