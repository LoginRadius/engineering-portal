Brands can achieve the goals of Customer Identity and Access management by using Change Management strategies. But before that, we must understand what change management is and what it can mean in the domain of digital security. 


## What is Change Management?

Change management is a systematic process that effectively transforms an organization's services, technology, or goals. The objective of change management is to analyze the situation and then accordingly implement strategies for undertaking change. 

The following are the common strategies implemented under change management:



* Planning and testing the visualized change.
* Creating a process for communication of change.
* Creating a system to schedule and implement change over some time.
* Setting up a documentation system for recording change.
* Establishing thresholds and standards to evaluate change.
* Ensuring [compliance with regulatory requirements](https://www.loginradius.com/compliances/).


## Implementing Change Management in Your Business in 3 Steps

Change management is an often-challenging endeavor that includes several steps, the first of which is securing customer identity. This is accomplished by carefully analyzing and investigating a customer’s behavior, as well as the details of their past interactions with the company.

The other steps include:


### 1. Enabling a holistic approach to change management.

Apart from the technology required in customer security, this strategy also focuses on the people implementing the technology. It does so by focusing on communication with the developers. A popular model for choosing the right developers is the skills, vision, incentives, and resources model. 

This essentially means choosing developers who either have these attributes, or creating a plan to instill these attributes into the developer. Here, the focus is on the skills and mindset of the developer. Along with this, incentives and appropriate resources are used to motivate the developer. 


### 2. Devising a concrete change management plan before implementation.

This strategy may seem obvious, but it is extremely necessary while undertaking change management in the IT sector. After steering up the goal of the change management process, it is necessary to devise a concrete management plan. 

This plan should take into consideration every possible requirement, outcome, and issue at every stage and accordingly create a structured resolution mechanism. This is essential because the implementation concerns [customer security](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-security/) and their data. If due to poor planning, a data breach occurs while undertaking change, it can affect the brand image, customer loyalty, and customer privacy. Thus, a well-constructed change management plan is key. 


### 3. Choosing the best leader.

Make a great plan, then manage it effectively. Choose the best leader to manage your plan, someone who can oversee the plan effectively. Effective oversight means following the change management procedure, from ensuring quality at each step to adequately resolving issues that arise.
