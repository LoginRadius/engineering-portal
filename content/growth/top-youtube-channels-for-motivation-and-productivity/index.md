If you are still reading this, you are on the path to be a winner. And winners don’t QUIT.

![Top Youtube Channels for Motivation and Productivity](Top-Youtube-Channels-for-Motivation-and-Productivity.png?ver=1553881376)So, how bad do you want to SUCCEED? Do you want it as bad as you want to breathe? Leave all your stuffs behind- Partying, fooling around, that basketball game on TV and whatever excuses you had which stopped you from performing. Focus and work on your habits because that’s how you will succeed. And for help, stretch out to a YouTube channel. Yes, you have heard it right. YouTube isn’t just for funny videos, silly prank invasions or drooling over Kardashian’s butt. They may relax you for while but they do no good. So, stop lurking and use YouTube for your own good. Get a daily dose of  videos from these channels which I have penned down, practice the idea and you will see the change in yourself.
