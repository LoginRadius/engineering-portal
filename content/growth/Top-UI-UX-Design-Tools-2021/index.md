[In May of this year](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience), Google is set to roll out the Google Page Experience update. It is critical for websites to meet this update’s criteria to be crawled and retain or improve their position on search engine result pages (SERPs). With this new update, only websites that provide a seamless and sophisticated online user experience (UX) will establish a secure position in online search rankings.

  

Research shows that [users prefer websites](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience) with an excellent page experience. The goal of this Google update is to enhance users’ overall web-browsing experience across all devices. Google will be using Core Web Vitals as direct page experience ranking factors. Thus, it is vital to have a solid understanding of Google Core Web Vitals to make sure your website’s user interface design and user experience or UX/UX design, meets the criteria.

  

Many understand how this new search ranking algorithm can make or break a business; however, not everyone has a solid plan on how to ensure their online success. There are digital marketing agencies providing [web design services](https://thriveagency.com/digital-marketing-services/web-design/) that can help. You can also use tools to check your website’s Core Web Vitals score and create your UI/UX design and an optimized user interface.

## What is UI/UX Design

  

Before we delve further into the different UI/UX design tools and Google Core Web Vitals, let’s answer a commonly asked question: What is UI/UX design or UX/UI design? What is UI/UX design for?

  

UX design and UI design are two different elements that work together and impact the web experience. UX design means “user experience design,” while UI design means “user interface design.”

  

UX design focuses on how an item works and how users interact with it. It is the invisible side of design and involves usability and function. UI design is centered on the visual, graphical and layout aspects of design. In the web design space, UX and UI designs go together to provide users with an enjoyable online browsing experience.

## What Are Google Core Web Vitals

  

Core Web Vitals quantify a user’s page experience through metrics that measure website speed, functionality and responsiveness:

  

-   Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): This measures the speed at which your site content loads. The LCP should not exceed 2.5 seconds for a given page.
    
-   First Input Delay (FID): This measures how long it takes for a page to become interactive. Ideally, it should take less than 100 ms.
    
-   Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): This checks if there is an unexpected layout shift of visual page content due to human interaction and how much. A good score is any number less than 0.1.
    

  

Other page experience factors affect your search rankings:

  

-   Mobile-friendliness: This checks how well your website performs on mobile devices.
    
-   Safe browsing: This evaluates how safe your page is from deceptive or malicious content.
    
-   HTTPS: This checks your website runs on a secure HTTPS connection.
    
-   No intrusive interstitials: This checks for any advertisements that may obscure your site content and make reading or site navigation challenging for users.
    

  

These page experience ranking factors and the newest addition - Google Core Web Vitals - are set to make pages safer and more enjoyable.

## How Can You Gauge Your Site’s Performance

There are several developer tools you can use to test your site on its user-friendliness and Core Web Vitals performance.

  

-   Lighthouse - This audits your page concerning the Core Web Vitals metrics. It delivers your overall score and offers suggestions for improvement. You can either download the Chrome extension or install it in your browser to generate a report.
    

  

-   PageSpeed Insights - This checks your page’s running and loading speed on desktop and mobile devices. Together with Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights runs a report measuring your site’s Core Web Vitals scores. You just need to paste your URL into the tool to generate the data you need.
    

  

-   Chrome DevTools Panel - You can install these extensions to measure page performance. One extension can simulate your page’s layout and performance on a mobile device. Another extension can identify and remove JavaScript errors on your page. There is also an extension that checks for unexpected layout shifts.
    

  

-   Web Vitals Extension - This desktop tool monitors your site’s Core Web Vitals in real-time.
    

  

-   Mobile-Friendly Test - You can input your page’s URL on this tool to check for mobile-friendliness. This tool gives you a screenshot of how your page appears to Google on a mobile device. It also lets you know of any mobile usability problems, such as incompatible plugins, incorrectly sized content or font.
    

  

-   Security Issues Report - This checks to ensure your site isn’t hacked and that it doesn’t pose any security threats towards users, such as malware or phishing attacks.
    

  

-   The HTTPS test - This checks if your site runs on a safe HTTPS connection.
    

  

These tools can give you the information needed to optimize your page. They can also expose security vulnerabilities and errors. While website owners should now start paying more attention to user experience, ensuring high-quality content is equally important. There needs to be a balance between providing excellent content and optimizing the UX/UI design for a great user experience. What is UI/UX design without quality content, after all?
