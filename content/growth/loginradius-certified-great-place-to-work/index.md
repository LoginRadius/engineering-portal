## Introduction

We are excited to announce that LoginRadius is now 'Great Place to Work-Certified’™! 

LoginRadius has always fostered a positive work culture and is excited to officially become ‘Great Place to Work-Certified.’ This certification is a natural move for us as it puts us on the international recognition stage. 

Great Place to Work is a global research and consulting firm helping companies recognize and build the best workplaces. We started our journey with them because we believe that having a great workplace culture makes people happy and productive, which means they can perform at their best.

We started this journey some time ago and could not be happier about earning this designation. 

This is huge for us as an organization because it shows our employees' level of trust and respect for their peers, enthusiasm, and willingness to [recommend LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/careers/) as a great place to work to all their friends/acquaintances.

Let’s look closely at the overall journey of becoming the best. 


## It All Starts with a Great Vision of Creating a Workplace Culture Where Everyone Wins

At LoginRadius, we strive to maintain the best work culture, and to ensure we're on the right track of employee satisfaction; we conducted the survey.

We believe that the ultimate success of any company is determined by its employees. That's why it's so essential for us to keep track of our employee engagement and satisfaction levels. We want everyone at LoginRadius to be happy and engaged in their work, with a positive outlook on their future here. 

The Great Place to Work ™ survey helped us do just that by giving us an insight into how our employees feel about their jobs, colleagues, and managers and what motivates them to deliver their best. 


## Preparing for the Survey

We started learning about this certification last year and connected with multiple people to understand more about it before proposing the idea to management. 

Once we got approval, we began working with the person concerned at Great Place to Work. We took one week to initiate the process and register ourselves for the certification.

From there, it took us one and a half months until we finally received our certificate—but throughout this process, we could see how much our employees loved working here.


## The Survey 

We know that to create a great workplace culture, you need to start by getting an accurate picture of what your employees think about it. 

Hence, we decided to ask every one of our employees to participate in an anonymous survey where they were presented with different key workplace metrics, including the working environment and their overall satisfaction with the culture in their team.

Great Place To Work evaluated LoginRadius' employees via anonymous feedback and used a Trust Index™ parameter to determine the final score. The survey assessed factors like the management’s credibility in competence, communication, integrity, appreciation for good work, and opportunities for personal development and training. 

We were blown away by the results! We found that our employees are overwhelmingly happy with their work environment and the culture at LoginRadius. The survey revealed that: 



* 97 percent believe that our workplace is psychologically and emotionally healthy.
* 94 percent believe that they can continue working with the organization for a long time.
* 90 percent believe that their performances are pretty evaluated. 


This is no small feat: creating a workplace culture where everyone wins takes effort from everyone involved—not just management but also from each employee. And now, thanks to this survey and its encouraging results, we know we're on the right track!
