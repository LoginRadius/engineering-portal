## Introduction

We all live in a digital realm where massive amounts of data is transmitted from one computer to another. This data is useful to organizations as it helps them to not only scale their business but at the same time also prioritize data personalization and privacy. 

Corporations worried about data privacy are developing shields and [safeguards to secure their corporate and customer digital possessions](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/consumer-data-privacy-security/).

Everywhere, [data security](https://www.loginradius.com/security/) is a top priority. This has been recognised by not just businesses with important data to guard but also individuals. However, people continue to make the same blunders when requested to disclose their email addresses to receive a ‘discount’ on a particular product. They frequently do so without reading the privacy statements first. Many businesses acquire such email addresses and utilize them unethically.

It's a privacy dichotomy. On one hand the companies talk about data privacy and at the same time they exploit consumer data for their benefit. The unlawful use of private details of a customer for any purpose without their awareness is a growing concern. 


## How to Make a Balance between Data Privacy and Personalization? 

Striking a balance between the need for data and customers’ privacy is critical to the success of any business. In order to ensure that they are in compliance with the law, companies should inform their consumers of how they intend to use the information they provide. Doing so will result in a mutually beneficial relationship whereby businesses generate more revenue, reach a greater number of potential customers, and enhance their brands by promoting greater transparency.

Here are some tried-and-tested methods for balancing data personalization and privacy. Let's take a closer look at them:


### 1. Gather data only that’s required for your business.

When dealing with your customers, you should ask for only the information you need to serve them. Do not obtain data from them that is not validated, and if you obtain sensitive information about a customer, ask permission before using it. If a customer refuses to agree to your request, do not use the information.


### 2. Inform your customers about how you plan to use the information.

It’s acceptable to ask for customers' contact info in order to send them coupons and discounts. However, keep in mind that using personal data without your [customers' consent](https://www.loginradius.com/consent-management/) can have severe implications. As a business owner, you need to communicate with your customers on how you intend to use their information.  


### 3. Data analysis can go a long way.

One of the most complicated problems to solve these days is data analysis. As a company, you have to be able to understand what your customers do with the products and services they acquire from you. If you can pinpoint those that contribute more than they cost, you'll always have loyal customers and great revenue. The complexity lies in finding out which features are appealing and how frequently users visit your site, among many other factors.


### 4. Listen to your customers, understand their problems, and avoid making false promises.

Don’t over promise or deliver late. This will harm your brand and sales. A great way to expand your business is through online marketing, even if you don’t consider yourself tech savvy. It’s easy to get started with digital marketing, whether you have a lot of money to spend or only a small budget. Never

 fake data, because this will cultivate mistrust between you and your customers. Instead, offer better products that provide more value and build lasting relationships with your customers.


## Summing it up

Implementing personalization in an effective manner is challenging. Hence, you need to consider every single step before executing a data protection strategy that meets your business goals without breaking the [laws of the land](https://www.loginradius.com/data-governance/). However, if done right, it can turn out to be a significant growth driver for your business and provide better ROI on marketing spend.
