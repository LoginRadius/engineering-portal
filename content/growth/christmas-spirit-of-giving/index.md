We want to give a big thank you and shout out to [Union Gospel Mission (UGM)](https://www.ugm.ca/) for giving us the opportunity to give back to the community! 

The holiday season serves as a great reminder to count our blessings. Many of us are fortunate in that we know which beds we’ll be sleeping in tonight. We consider hunger as an occasional discomfort we can easily solve. For gifts, we expect beautiful, new items from malls and boutiques rather than second-hand or dollar store finds. But we shouldn’t feel guilty. Instead, let’s feel grateful for the blessings we get to enjoy.

As we count our blessings, the holiday season also reminds us not to simply give, but to embrace _the joy of giving_. With the help of UGM, the team at LoginRadius got to do just that. We celebrated the holiday season by preparing gifts for the residents at one of UGM Vancouver’s housing facilities. 

Together, the LoginRadius team wrote Christmas cards and assembled gift bags full of goodies. Each bag had necessities _and_ treats, including socks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, gloves, candies, and chocolates.

As LoginRadius grows from a tech startup to an established corporation, we’re reminded that the joy of giving is year-round. We feel lucky that we can contribute to projects that help our community. In fact, some of our own team members could have benefited from organizations like UGM in the past—our own CEO grew up in a rural village without running water or electricity. 

Our night of preparing gifts and cards for UGM was a great way to get into the Christmas spirit. We hope you enjoy these photos and get inspired to help your local community, too.
