## Introduction

We’re living in a digital-first era where knowing your targeted audience is the key to business success. Moreso, today brands can craft [personalized experiences](https://www.loginradius.com/customer-experience-solutions/) and cater to them with the services they expect. 

When a brand meets its customers’ expectations through personalized and relevant experiences, customer loyalty is earned, promoting the brand. 

However, most brands mistakenly target the wrong customers since they’re unable to recognize who their customers are and what their various touchpoints are. 

Since businesses serve customers across various devices and channels, yielding multiple views of the same customer becomes tricky. And the result is a messed experience that hampers customer experience and expectations, leading to mistaken identity. 

So, what can be the ideal solution to overcome the dilemma of mistaken identity?

A [customer identity management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/) solution could be the game-changer in overcoming mistaken identity challenges. 

A customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution can be the best way to ensure zero data redundancy and provide a unified customer view across multiple platforms and devices. 

Let’s dig deeper into the aspects of leveraging a CIAM solution to overcome the challenges of mistaken identity. 


## What is Mistaken Identity? Why Should Brands Worry About it?

Mistaken identity is a situation where brands mistakenly recognize a user based on their behavior and preferences, but eventually, they’re not the ones per their data. 

Online platforms collect vast information about their users, but that information isn’t synced with all the devices and touchpoints. This leads to data redundancy and messes up information that further hampers personalization and user-focused marketing tactics. 

In a nutshell, brands targeting the wrong person based on specific data fail to meet their actual customers’ needs and expectations, making them lag behind their competitors. 

And when the competition is neck-to-neck, brands can’t afford to lose a single customer just because of wrong insights about that particular customer. Hence, enterprises should quickly put their best foot forward in analyzing a giant loophole and fixing it at the earliest. 

On the other hand, when brands leverage the true potential of valuable and relevant user insights that portray user behavior and preferences, they can create personalized experiences right from the moment a user interacts with their platform. And this improves overall [conversion rates](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/sign-up-tips-conversion-rate/). 


## The Critical Role of Customer Identity Management Solution in Overcoming Mistaken Identity Issues

Customer identity management solutions, commonly known as customer identity and access management (CIAM), can help brands collect insightful and relevant information about every customer across multiple platforms and devices. 

The information is synched in real-time, and unified data regarding a particular user is generated that helps create rich, personalized experiences to boost customer engagement. 

Let’s closely look at some of the business advantages of incorporating an identity management solution through a CIAM. 


### #1. Omni-channel customer experience

An omnichannel customer experience refers to seamless interaction across multiple channels. Consumer expectations include speed, flexibility, reliability, and transparency.

For example, it is omnichannel when marketing, sales, consumer support, and even in-store experiences are synced up so users can seamlessly switch channels and make the purchase.

### #2. Single consumer view

A single consumer view (also known as SCV) is where all consumers' data is stored securely and presented as an easy-to-read record. 

It may include the basic information about a consumer, the past and present purchasing data, all interactions with customer service, and their social media behavior under a single admin panel. It assists brands in having an in-depth insight into their consumers.


## #3.Strengthened security

In an age where sensational hacking and malicious attacks have become the order of the day, enhanced safeguard against the ever-looming threats is indispensable.

By adding multiple layers of shields, [new-age CIAM](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/new-age-ciam/) brings into effect strengthened security. Thus, the entire cluster of data remains protected from the prying eyes or, for that matter, falling prey to data trackers.

New-age CIAM takes advantage of [multi-factor authentication](https://www.loginradius.com/multi-factor-authentication/) to guard against unauthorized access. Each layer is designed with the utmost security to prevent hackers from breaking into the account.

While MFA keeps a tab on the security checks, adaptive authentication aims at simplifying the process. Driven by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, the new-age CIAM adapts over time for a more personalized experience.


## In Conclusion 

Mistaken identity can be a big hurdle in the overall growth of a business, especially if an enterprise is creating personalized customer journeys and relying heavily on user data. 

Not getting correct and relevant information could lead to a situation where brands cannot recognize their potential targetted customers and their needs. 

CIAM ensures brands have a better understanding of consumers. Hence, they can quickly figure out what clicks for their consumers and what they must do to get rid of.

Add to that the top-of-the-line shield against the prying eyes, and the new-age CIAM seems to be a must for modern enterprises.
