## Introduction 

When we think of customer-centric marketing, we tend to imagine a brand with a website that’s easy to navigate and use, or a mobile app that is responsive and intuitive, or in-store displays that are informative and engaging.

But what if there were an even more important aspect to consider? What if the way a company treats its customers on social media was as important as any other aspect of customer experience?

Today, retailers need to look beyond just the one aspect of their customer experience. They also need to think about: 



* customer’s [omnichannel fulfillment](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/what-is-omnichannel-cx/) (including web sales),
* personalized product recommendations based on purchase history,
* friction-free checkout processes (so people don't leave because of check-out errors),
* better pricing models that make sense for consumers (you know, like buying something online instead of at the store),
* and so much more!

That's why customer-centric marketing is so important in this time of uncertainty—and why retailers should be focusing on it now.

In this blog post, we'll dive into [how retailers can truly make their customers happy](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/consumer-management-to-consumer-engagement/) by advocating customer-centric marketing. 


## Breaking Down Your Business Model: 4 Strategies to Master Customer-Centricity

When it comes to customer-centric marketing, you should always be thinking about how your brand fits into your customers' lives—and not just at the point of sale. Here are some tips to help you out! 


### 1. Prefer customer performance indicators (CPIs) over traditional marketing KPIs.

You need to start thinking about your customer's needs from a new perspective. For example, take into account how they want to be treated and what their goals are. Next, you need to figure out how to help them achieve those goals through your [marketing campaigns](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/customize-marketing-programs-on-consumer-journey/).

The rise of customer performance indicators (CPIs) is a game-changer for traditional marketing. While traditional KPIs are merely an indicator of whether a company is succeeding or failing, CPIs take a more holistic approach to understanding what customers want from their companies.

Moreso, CPIs help understand how customers use their products or services and make real-time adjustments based on those insights. They also allow companies to figure out the impact of their marketing efforts and make strategic decisions about how best to spend their limited resources.


### 2. Invest in infrastructure.

One of the most important things you can do to become customer-centric is invest in infrastructure that will help you serve your customers better.



* Get a clear picture of who your customers are, what they care about and why they buy from you.
* Study how customers interact with your products or services and identify pain points.
* Create a new way of thinking about how to serve your customers by focusing on their needs and buying patterns instead of just trying to sell them something new every time they need something new!
* Focus on continually [improving the user experience](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/how-to-improve-the-customer-xperience/) (UX) by investing in research, testing, learning and providing feedback loops that keep everyone involved in a state of constant improvement.
* Build empathy into your own business processes by listening carefully to what your customers say about their experiences, then using that information to build better versions.

### 3. A seamless customer onboarding.

The most important thing to remember when designing an onboarding flow is to make sure that it's simple and easy. You don't want to confuse your new customers—or even frustrate them!

The sign-up process is often the starting point for a [seamless customer onboarding](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/smooth-onboarding-positive-user-impression/) experience, and it's an area where businesses often fall short. Here's what you can do to make the process as seamless as possible.



* Keep it short. Think about how many steps you can take without losing users. If you can have them "sign up" with just a few clicks and they're ready to go, that's great!
* If you have too much information to gather, split them into multiple interactions throughout their lifecycle. That's [how progressive profiling works](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/progressive-profiling/).
* Make it easy for people to sign up with their social login. That takes the pain away from remembering passwords. 


### 4.  Optimize every possible customer touchpoint.

The key to customer-centric marketing is to optimize every customer touchpoint. Optimizing means making sure that the customers' experience with your business is as easy and pleasurable as possible. 

It doesn't mean that you have to be perfect at everything all the time. But it does mean that you need to think about how every single bit of your business affects the customer experience.

So, here's what you can do:



* Start with the basics. What do you think is the first thing a customer sees when they visit your website? Your home page? Your landing page? Well, the first thing they see doesn't matter! Rather, you want them to be able to find what they're looking for quickly and easily.
* Make it easy. How can you make sure that everything on your website is simple and easy to navigate? That could mean adding more images or videos than text, and using bold colors instead of subtle ones.
* Make it fast. How fast can a customer find what they're looking for on your website? If it takes too long, they might leave before even getting started with an order. 


## In Conclusion 

A customer-centric approach to marketing means that businesses are no longer focused on the products and services themselves, but instead prefer to understand the needs and wants of their customers. And that’s exactly what you need to do to lead this era of customer-centric marketing.
