## Introduction 

We all know that marketing is complex. And when we have hundreds of competitors in the ever-expanding digital landscape, marketing becomes an uphill battle. 

However, a major proportion of your marketing begins the moment a user interacts with your platform. If you can deliver them the experience they expect, you’re on the right track in promoting your services/product. 

Promoting your brand and delivering out-of-the-box services reinforced with robust security is paramount for business success. However, delivering rich experiences remains the most underrated catalyst that can pave the path for exponential growth! 

Over the years, [customer identity management for business](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/new-age-ciam/) is helping enterprises bridge the gap between user experience and security that further improves engagement and trust. 

Whether you talk about any renowned brand or a Fortune 500 company, they’re leveraging the perfect harmony of quality services, stringent security, and a great user experience through identity management. 

In a nutshell, information technology and marketing may seem as different as night and day, but their perfect symphony is crucial for business success. 

Let’s uncover the business advantages of incorporating IT and marketing in harmony and how enterprises can reap the best results through customer identity management. 


## User Experience and Marketing - Why Begin at the Registration Phase? 

We have the tendency to switch a website in a couple of seconds if we’re not pleased with the user experience during the first encounter. 

Now, imagine searching for a casual pair of shoes online and landing on an XYZ e-commerce store. 

You’re exploring the website, and within a couple of seconds, you’re bombarded with registration forms with many fields asking for your personal information, including name, address, phone number, email, and more. 

Remember, you haven’t yet checked the casual shoes you’re searching for! 

Will you fill out that complete form and then search for the shoes you’ve been looking for? Absolutely not! What will be your next course of action? 

You’ll just close the window and search for the same shoes on another platform that offers a seamless experience and allows you to check out your desired goods quickly. 

The same thing happens with other users globally!

Hence, to ensure your marketing works flawlessly, you need to set the seal on your platform’s user experience, especially when users interact with the brand for the first time and are asked for early registration. 

A [customer identity and access management](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/customer-identity-and-access-management/) (CIAM) solution can gradually help enterprises collect crucial user information through progressive profiling.

Through progressive profiling, users aren’t bombarded with big registration forms; instead, they are asked to share their details when they interact with the platform gradually. This ensures a seamless and rich user experience.

## What About Security? Should it be a Part of Preference Management and Digital Experience Strategy?

Security is the backbone of any business delivering online services in the modern digital landscape. However, most companies overlook the importance of incorporating a stringent security mechanism in their digital experience and [preference management](https://www.loginradius.com/consent-management/) strategy. 

Since various security compliances and data regulations like the GDPR and CCPA are becoming more stringent, enterprises need to understand that offering a great user experience while compromising security and privacy could be the worst thing for their business. 

Although most customers are concerned about how businesses collect, store, and manage their personal information, many still don’t care about their data security. 

Whether your customers are concerned about security or not, you need to ensure your business complies with all the necessary security and data privacy regulations. 

But again, the game of adding compliances and increasing security indirectly revolves around compromising user experience, which hampers all the marketing efforts. 

So, what could be the ideal solution for overcoming this dilemma of [balancing user experience with security](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/balancing-security-cx/)?

A customer identity and access management solution could help overcome the challenges of creating a perfect harmony between user experience, security, and global compliances. 

Hence, if a business is leveraging a reliable CIAM solution and ensuring security, user experience, and compliance, its marketing would deliver outstanding results like a breeze. 

Marketers need not worry regarding the overall security of consumer data. They can promote their brand to deliver a great user experience since they’re backed with a robust security mechanism. 

Also, users don’t hesitate to share their consent when they know their data is being safely handled. This can again help businesses collect crucial information that can further help create personalized consumer journeys.
