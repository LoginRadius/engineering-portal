### 3. Compliance with Regulations

In an increasingly regulated digital landscape, businesses must adhere to strict compliance standards to protect customer data and maintain operational legality. 

Identity verification aids in complying with various data security and privacy regulations, ensuring that businesses operate within legal boundaries and avoid penalties. These regulations include the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA.
