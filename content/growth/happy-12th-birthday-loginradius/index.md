## Introduction

As we celebrate the 12th anniversary of LoginRadius, I find myself reflecting on our remarkable journey. 

When we first set out, we had a vision to revolutionize digital identity and streamline the user experience. Today, as we stand on the cusp of our teenage years, it’s incredible to see how far we’ve come and exciting to envision the road ahead.

Let’s have a quick glimpse of this incredible journey and learn more about our accomplishments over the past year. 

## The Early Days: A Dream Takes Shape

The inception of LoginRadius was fueled by a simple yet powerful idea: to make online identities secure, seamless, and user-friendly. 

Back in 2012, we noticed a gap in the market—a need for a comprehensive identity solution that could cater to businesses of all sizes. Armed with this insight and driven by a passion for innovation, we embarked on a mission to fill this void.

## Overcoming Challenges: Resilience and Adaptability

The path to where we are today was far from smooth. We faced numerous challenges, from technological hurdles to market competition. 

However, each obstacle served as a learning experience, strengthening our resolve and shaping our strategy. Our resilience and adaptability allowed us to navigate these challenges and emerge stronger.

## Innovation at Our Core: Milestones and Achievements

Innovation has always been at the heart of LoginRadius. Over the past 12 years, we have achieved several significant milestones that have propelled us forward:

### 1. Push Notifications MFA 

LoginRadius has introduced a revolutionary feature: [Push Notification MFA](https://www.loginradius.com/push-notification-mfa/). Delivering SMS and email OTPs can be cumbersome, and entering TOTPs often creates friction for your customers. 

With Push Notification MFA, you can streamline the authentication process by sending notifications directly to your customers' Android and iOS devices, allowing them to approve or deny access with just a tap.

### 2. Passkeys 

LoginRadius has unveiled an innovative feature: [Passkeys](https://www.loginradius.com/passkeys-login-authentication/).

By eliminating the need for passwords, LoginRadius is setting a new standard in customer identity and access management.

Voice OTP enhances account security while simplifying the user verification process.
