## Introduction

In any business, it is crucial to keep trade secrets confidential. Companies implement laws for data preservation while handling sensitive information. Along with these laws, employees need to be reassured that the information is retained in an appropriate space. Disclosure of the consumer's identity can be due to any breach of privacy. Such a breach can lead to loss of business, market reputation, and clients. Also, such acts destroy the employees' trust and impact their loyalty towards the company. To avoid such huge losses, you must [apply strict data protection rules](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/maintaining-quality-data-security-practices/) while dealing with private information.

With time, Peter understood that he had made a big mistake. After his big identity reveal, Peter Parker faced a bundle of troubles in his personal life. His Aunt May and Mary Jane were at risk all the time. Also, this event destroyed his relationship with Mary Jane and cancelled their marriage. Due to all these controversies, Peter Parker's initial glory went for a toss, and he ended up in a constant state of dread.

### 3. Personal liability

When dealing with personal information in business, it is crucial to be extra careful to prevent identity disclosure. Any criminal breach of your business information will harm your personal liability and can disturb your survival in the market.
