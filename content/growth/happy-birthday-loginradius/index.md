20th July marked a special occasion at [LoginRadius](https://www.linkedin.com/company/loginradius/) as we celebrated our company's anniversary. My baby will be a teenager in two years! An emotional moment for me.

I’m struck by the profound similarity between our journey as founders and the experience of raising a child. Just like parents nurture and care for their baby, we have poured our hearts and souls into building and nurturing LoginRadius.

Throughout this incredible journey, I have experienced a whirlwind of emotions—pride, joy, worry, and excitement. We have celebrated together during moments of triumph, persevered through challenging times, and shared in the deep sense of pride that comes with witnessing the growth and accomplishments of LoginRadius.

Similar to parents who witness their child's first steps and watch them blossom into independent individuals, I have had the privilege of witnessing LoginRadius evolve, adapt, and mature. In its early years, our "baby" required abundant care and attention, but it has now grown into a strong, independent, and adaptable entity. As a founder, I have learned and evolved so much alongside LoginRadius, and it has shaped me into a better human being. In just two more years, LoginRadius will enter its teenage years, and I have unwavering faith that it will continue to thrive and make a remarkable impact on the IAM space.

Firstly, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to each team member of LoginRadius for being an integral part of this incredible journey and for helping me in building this company. Without your unwavering support and valuable contributions, none of this would have been possible. I would also like to thank our former staff members who played vital roles. Also, great thanks to our vendors, partners, and advisors.

Secondly, I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have the unwavering support of some truly exceptional investors who have stood by my side through every challenge and triumph. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to [Real Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/company/real-ventures/), [Forgepoint Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forgepoint-capital/), [M12 - Microsoft's Venture Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/m12vc/), [Yaletown Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yaletown-partners-inc-/), [BDC Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bdc-capital/), Accelerate AB, and our esteemed angel investors, particularly [Laurie Wallace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurie-wallace-960783?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAdNZgB7KwREZUmz-85oztl8HhF_CUNejM) and [Shaheel Hooda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaheel?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAVNc8BLQZ_IoKlNK5fh7-dun4rLmPRC0w). Your belief in our vision and commitment to our journey have been invaluable. Your guidance, resources, and encouragement have played a pivotal role in our growth and success. I cannot thank you enough for being outstanding partners, and I deeply appreciate your continued support.

And most importantly, I take a moment to express our deepest gratitude to our exceptional customers, you are the very reason we exist as a company today. It is because of your unwavering support, trust, and loyalty that we have reached this significant milestone today. Your invaluable feedback and continuous patronage have been instrumental in shaping our growth and success. Your participation in the Customer Innovation Council helped us innovate our CIAM platform to the next level. We are deeply grateful for the strong partnerships we have formed with you and look forward to continuing this journey together. Thank you for being an essential part of our story, and here's to many more years of fruitful partnership!


## Our Story

I still vividly remember the day when I incorporated the company on Jul 20, 2012. At that time, all we had was an idea—an idea to solve the "login" problem for billions of internet users.

We began by offering a simple social login widget for the long-tail market and later joined the FounderFuel accelerator program in 2013. The experience taught us invaluable lessons, and it was after that when we started building a dedicated team. In 2014, we raised our seed funding of $1.3M.

As we continued building our business around social login, our customers provided feedback, expressing that it only solved a portion of their "login" pain. Listening to our customers, as we always do, we realized it was time to address the "login" challenges comprehensively and once for all. With this in mind, we began developing the Customer IAM platform, focusing on three core philosophies: 



1. Offering a secure and privacy-compliant login experience to customers
2. Liberating developers from all aspects of Customer Identities
3. Specializing in Customer IAM

In 2016, we set off to develop the new platform, and in 2017, we proudly launched the no-code CIAM platform. The market's reception was overwhelming, and the idea of LoginRadius transformed into a successful business.

Since then, we have grown to a team of over 100 employees, serving more than 600 brands globally, including numerous Fortune 500 customers. Our dedication and commitment have been recognized by leading analysts firms such as KuppingerCole, Forrester, and Gartner, ranking us as top CIAM vendors.

Despite the challenges posed by COVID, we successfully navigated the situation and became a profitable company in 2021, minimizing any financial risks. Our journey of growth and expansion continues.


## Why I’m excited as the CEO

It has been an incredible 11-year journey, and yet, I can't help but feel like we are just getting started. As we enter this exciting growth phase of our company, we are poised to create even greater value in the next two years than we have in the entirety of the past 11 years.

I am incredibly excited about LoginRadius, and allow me to share the reasons why:


### Continue Growing as a Profitable Business

We anticipate experiencing remarkable growth in the coming years, and what excites me further is our ability to operate as a profitable business. With our strong cash position and incredible investor backing, coupled with operating profitability, we have an enhanced ability to execute effectively, particularly amidst the current macroeconomic conditions.


### Product Innovation

Our relentless focus on the Customer IAM use case has led us to build an industry-leading platform. However, we are taking innovation to a whole new level with a lineup of excellent products and AI capabilities in our next 12-month product roadmap. These incoming products will add immense value to our customers and their end-users, furthering our vision of no-code Customer IAM and propelling us ahead of our impressive competitors, especially Okta/Auth0 and ForgeRock. PS: I have immense respect for these two companies.


### Building the GTM leadership team

Up until now, I have taken on three roles - Head of Sales, Head of Marketing, and CEO. However, we are making significant strides by transitioning the first two roles to two exceptional leaders.  I'm thrilled to onboard these talented leaders and implement the exciting GTM strategies that I have envisioned.


### Massive CIAM Market is Experiencing Incredible Growth

The COVID pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation by 6 years. With identity serving as the first layer of digital interaction, all these enterprises need CIAM to successfully implement their digital transformation initiatives, thus giving a significant boost to CIAM demand for the next 10 years. With such a vast market opportunity, multiple players are required to meet the growing demand.


### Incredible Growth Ahead

When all these pieces are tied together, I am filled with excitement about LoginRadius' potential for incredible growth in the coming years. We have set ambitious goals to double the company in the next two years while remaining profitable, and we are already looking ahead to doubling again within the following 18 months. It's an exhilarating time for us!

Have a great week!
