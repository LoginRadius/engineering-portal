## What is Progressive Profiling?

Progressive profiling is the method of collecting personal information about the client step-by-step. It helps the digital marketing team to streamline the lead nurturing process by gathering increasingly specific client data.

The best thing about progressive profiling is that the same question won't repeat twice. For example, if the lead has already provided their email address, name, and phone number, they won't be asked for it again.

Instead, when the lead arrives on the landing page for the second time, they will be asked different questions like their company name, home address, and much more.

In this way, digital marketing teams obtain several data points about a lead without annoying or overwhelming them with long forms in the first interaction itself.

Hence, if a business strives for quality leads, it must incorporate the true potential of progressive profiling that eventually helps generate quality leads.
