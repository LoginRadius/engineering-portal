## Introduction

A never-ending registration form is the least favorite thing that you would like to see when you land on a website for the first time. The same goes for your potential customers! 

Users don’t prefer sharing their personal information in the first interaction, which is why most of them switch in a couple of seconds —leading to poor lead quality. 

Though customer information is the fuel to keep a business up and running, enterprises need to understand that they must find a better way to collect valuable information without annoying the users. 

Here’s where the critical role of [progressive profiling](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/presenting-progressive-profiling-loginradius/) comes into play! 

Progressive profiling ensures valuable information about a user is gradually collected over time so that it doesn’t create friction while a user lands on a platform, which enhances the overall quality and number of leads. 

Let’s understand in detail what role progressive profiling play in [improving overall lead quality](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/growth/sign-up-tips-conversion-rate/) and quantity. 


## What is Progressive Profiling?

Progressive profiling is the method of collecting personal information about the client step-by-step. It helps the digital marketing team to streamline the lead nurturing process by gathering increasingly specific client data.

The best thing about progressive profiling is that the same question won't repeat twice. For example, if the lead has already provided their email address, name, and phone number, they won't be asked for it again.

Instead, when the lead arrives on the landing page for the second time, they will be asked different questions like their company name, home address, and much more.

In this way, digital marketing teams obtain several data points about a lead without annoying or overwhelming them with long forms in the first interaction itself.

Hence, if a business strives for quality leads, it must incorporate the true potential of progressive profiling that eventually helps generate quality leads.
