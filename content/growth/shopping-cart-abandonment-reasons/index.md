Well, here is a detailed description in the form of list of reasons about why buyers abandon their cart and what you can do to save your site from the adverse effects of cart abandonment.

### **1\. Your Checkout is Too Complicated**

An analysis from Bronto (an email marketing company) observes that there is an [average of 5.6 pages](http://www.linkedarray.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/White-paper-ecommerce.pdf) is between cart and order confirmation. People don’t like spending hours shopping online. When they visit your online store, they probably know what they want and hence want the process to be straight and quick. Hence, your sales funnel of 9 pages from cart to checkout will force them to abandon the cart and thus you may lose your revenue.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Think like a customer and provide them a simple sales flow with an average of 2 to 3 steps. Take smart steps in acquiring information from your users. For example, the official Vancouver Olympic store shortened their checkout process from 4 pages to 2 pages and improved their checkout [conversion rate by 21.8%](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/psychological-principles-converting-website/). Hence, it does not matter if you ask all of your required information in one page and dedicate the other page for the payment and checkout process. Also design a visual checkout process for your users as they like to see themselves in control of the process or know where is the process heading towards.

### **2\. You are Forcing your Customers To Sign Up**

Some people do not like when you force them for a signup process, even if it is included as a step when they are shopping for themselves. According to Forrester, forcing to register before buying a commodity can [hamper the customer experience of 23% customers](https://www.forrester.com/report/Understanding+Shopping+Cart+Abandonment/-/E-RES56827).

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Start by providing a guest login option for your customers. Position your “register” button at the end of the checkout process for better sales. An e-commerce site increased their [sales by $300 million](https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/) when they placed their ‘registration’ button at the end of the checkout process. I know the importance of registrations in an online business but to make your customers sign up at the cost of buying a thing is not a done thing. Thus, if you want to boost the number of signups on your website, attract your customers with offers and discounts they can avail by registering themselves. However, the registration process should be quick and uncomplicated.


### **3\. Your Site has Hidden Costs and High Shipping Charges**

People like surprises but it is not true when it comes to hidden charges. Hidden charges annoy a customer like anything and is not at all healthy for your business.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Be entirely transparent when it comes to your product’s extra charges and policies. Display everything at the product’s page and ensure that the shipping charges are visible on the checkout page. Moreover, if possible provide free shipping as [84% buyers](https://aytm.com/blog/daily-survey-results/free-shipping-survey/) are more likely to shop with brands that offer them free shipping. And if your are not able to provide free shipping to your customers (as these charges bite into your profits), offer them free shipping at the purchase of certain amount.

### **4\. Your Site Does not Display a Shipping Date**

If your site does not provide an information about shipping or delivery date, there are chances that your customer can walk out of the deal.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Provide an option to check the delivery date on the product page.

### **5\. There is no guarantee of Lowest Price or Price Protection**

Your site does not guarantee your customers of lowest price available online or offers a price protection guarantee. A consumer will feel cheated if he finds out that another site has provides the same product at lower prices.

**_How can You Save Yourself_**

 

Promise lowest price guarantees and lay a price protection tag on your products which means that if there is a price drop of a product within a given period, the price difference will be returned (upto certain amount) to the customer.

### **6\. Your Site Shows The Price in a Foreign Currency**

It might be a reason for many international customers to boo away your website. If you are dealing with international customers, you should be capable of providing options to the customers to choose their local currency. Your customers may not have the knowledge about the current exchange rates and are not supposed to take an extra burden of researching about it.

**_How can You Save Yourself_**

 

Select payment methods and a gateway that helps you to provide more currency options to your customer.

### **7\. Your Site Does not have Security Logos**

Security on a website is one of the most sought aspects by customers while shopping online. So, if your payment options do not look secured enough to customers, they will never be comfortable to share their personal information and make purchases on your website.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Essentially, make sure that your site has a high end security environment. Now, get a certificate of your encryption security. If necessary, outsource the payment process to a trusted name in the market like PayPal or BitPay (ensure that you are PCI compliant). After this, display your security logos on your checkout page. It will certainly improve sales.

### **8\. You Have Poor Customer Service**

Well, it is not only security features that customers look for. They also look for a great customer support. So, if you lack a great customer support team, you better take a serious step on amending it. Also, your team might not be approachable to your customers i.e. you may not have any put any contact details or a customer helpline on your website.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Develop a great team  for customer support and make your team available for your customers 24\*7. Also, display your helpline number or provide your chat assistance on every page on your website, especially during checkout process.

### **9\. You Have Limited Delivery Options or Slower Delivery**

The online options which you provide are not enough for your customers. Other than that, you are slower in delivery of goods than your competitors.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Support worldwide delivery and have diverse pricing ranges based on the region (if possible, provide free shipping to foreign countries accompanied by win-win conditions).  Speed as a matter of fact, is very important when it comes to delivery. So, improve your delivery process as much as possible. Well, you cannot overcome every obstacle but can mitigate the effects.

### **10\. N****o reviews Spoil The Game**

Reviews influence purchasing decisions to some extent. May it be your site’s review or review of your product, it can affect your sales. [70% of customers](http://www.peopleclaim.com/blog/index.php/the-review-of-ratings/) consider ratings and reviews before they purchase anything.

**_How can You Save Yourself_**

 

Make the latest coupon and promo codes available on your site during the checkout phase. Moreover, if you are a rare provider of coupon codes, please hide that coupon box. However, you can make it visible exclusively for your customers who land at your website through a promotional email. Also introduce strategies like including previous and updated prices on the product like “the product was $$$ and now is $$”or messages like you saved $$$. Everyone loves a great deal, right!

**Some other reasons which indirectly affect cart abandonment**

### **12\. Your Website is Too Slow or has a Poor Design**

Your online customers nothing different to offline customers. As offline customers hate standing in a long queue, similarly your online customers will hate your slow loading webpages. Also, a confusing navigation process where customers cannot find categories or a poorly designed website can frustrate the customers and force them to abandon your cart.

**_How can you save yourself_**

 

Optimizing your website is the first thing to do. Eliminate unnecessary elements from your pages and boost the response time of your website. For improving navigation, you can introduce CTA buttons with simple and clear instructions to keep the things in order. Focus on designing a simple checkout process and displaying the cart summary on every page during the checkout phase. Also, ensure that the focus of the customers is not deviated from the ‘pay’ or ‘buy now’ button during the checkout process.

### **13\. Your Website isn’t Mobile Friendly**
