##Deep learning in daily life projects

#Bio-robotics#
Bio-robotics is becoming an emerging field and is responsible for creation of commercialized products such as exoskeletons, prosthetics and robotic wheelchairs.
The EMG(electromyography) signals have been enormously used for bio-robotics,however various challenges are faced in this arena. The electroencephalography-(EEG) based 
control methods are used to manufacture the components of these applications.
The assistive robots depending on this strategy have improved the quality of life of elderly and disabled people.
Bio-robotics has improved life especially for the disabled ,physically weak and  injured people. Bio-robotics has various applications such as exoskeletons, prosthetics, intelligent    wheelchairs and  teleoperation robots that are making a great impact on everyday life.


#CAD systems#
The major modality used for PCa detection is  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as it is acquired in the radiation free area making its visibility better.
So, the area of developing MRI based Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for PCa is becoming one of the most dynamic areas of research these days. 
The examinations that are able to detect PCa  are mainly  manual and consume a lot of time. Time-consuming therefore, CAD system reduces the computational complexion
with increased accuracy in the detection of PCa.
This requires preprocessing the data followed by the segmentation of the required region of interest.

#Automatic cars#
There are self-driven cars using deep learning of detecting teh objects in the way to  recognize data and make self-driving cars.

#Drones#
They detect people from far away and help in delivery of products using unique id per person. Also they help to extinguish fire using 
the deep learning and object detection and recognition.
