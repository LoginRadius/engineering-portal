# How Git Local Repository Works

Let's understand how git set up a local repository
Once we initialize or clone any git project that will set up a local project environment.

that whole environment will look like the below picture

**Project Folder**: The main folder consists of a workspace and local repository

**Work Directory**: Inside Project Folder where we actually work,  we keep all files and perform many operations like addition, update, deletion of files

**Local Repository**: Here we don't actually change anything, this is handled automatically by git. this consists **staging area**, **commit history**, **stash area** etc.



Let's get into it step by step and see how we perform command or action and behind the scene, git do its own activity. 

- Step 1. Git clone and project:
