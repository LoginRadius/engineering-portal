Companies have forever relied on the data import process to get a centralized view of data and drive smarter business decisions. Even today, integrating data from legacy systems and other sources remains a key component of a company's identity toolbox. 

The LoginRadius Identity Import Manager is a flexible tool that allows companies to import and manage multiple customer profile data from any different application, service, or database into the LoginRadius database via CSV files. 

With the new feature, companies can be confident about the consistency and accuracy of the imported data.

## Intent Behind the Launch 

LoginRadius understands that when companies take more time to migrate the data from legacy systems, it increases their go-to-market time. With the Identity Import Manager, we aim to automate the migration process with 100% precision.

We understand data import and update requirements. We tightly connect different data elements with a unified user profile.

Other benefits of the LoginRadius Identity Import Manager include:

- It is easier and faster than traditional methods that move data by writing codes manually 
- It improves data professionals' productivity as it codifies and reuses processes that move data without any technical intervention. 
- It offers a robust built-in-error handling functionality that empowers companies to build well-instrumented data warehousing systems.

## A Final Word

Companies produce a wide range of data in a variety of forms that may not be fully integrated. Additionally, they collect data from external sources that they require to import into their systems.
