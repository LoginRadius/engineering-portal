So, here presenting before you some different kinds of subject lines and some must follow steps which can take your email marketing strategies to a whole new level.

### **Curiosity**

**_You can add elements of curiosity like:-_**

- Introducing interesting surprises in the mail (Eg:- Don’t forget, **Surprise Gift Waiting for you**)

- Asking them interesting questions (Eg:- How to make $100 per day? Answer Inside!!).

Using humour for email marketing demands creativity and thought but it can prove fruitful in respect to open rates. If you are capable of making your audience laugh, your efforts can pay off. Some funny examples from some nice brands to get inspired and tickle your funny bone:-

### **Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)**

You cannot resist the feeling of “missing out” an opportunity. Fear Of Missing Out is an psychological human attribute which you can use in your email marketing drive. How? Just add a bit of urgency or scarcity to your subject line. As discussed above, the element boosts open rates. Some great examples from the brand name **digital marketer** for you to refer:-

- **Digital Marketer:** “\[WEEKEND ONLY\] Get this NOW before it’s gone…”
- **Digital Marketer:** “Your 7-figure plan goes bye-bye at midnight…”
