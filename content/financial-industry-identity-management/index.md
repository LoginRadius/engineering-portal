The financial industry has a deep-rooted relationship with its customers. After all, handling mortgages, retirement savings, home, and personal loans require the highest level of trust. It comes from ensuring that the right people have access to the right information.

Likewise, a robust identity management system helps financial organizations [remain compliant and conduct business](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2020/03/how-loginradius-helps-enterprises-stay-ccpa-compliant-in-2020/) in a secure environment.

The COVID-19 outbreak has led to fresh strings of phishing and real-time identity thefts. As countries across the globe are rolling out financial iterations in response to the pandemic like tax due-date extension and new direct stimulus payments, fraudsters are using this as an outright theft opportunity.

## Recent Cyber Attacks in the Finance Industry

- According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans alone have [lost $13.4 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/15/americans-have-lost-13point4-million-to-fraud-linked-to-covid-19.html) to coronavirus-related fraud in 2020 so far. 

- On April 15, 2020, the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI declared that the North Koreans have used [cyber attacks to steal](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-106a) some $2 billion over the past decade. 

- According to VMware Carbon Black analytics, the global financial industry saw a 38% increase in cyberattacks and [148% spike in ransomware attacks](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/252481832/Ransomware-attacks-see-148-surge-amid-COVID-19) between February and March 2020. 
    
- As the estimated global cost of cyber attacks stands [between $45bn and $654bn](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cyber-attack-financial-crisis-christine-lagarde-ecb-a9322556.html), ECB chief Christine Lagarde warns the world of a plausible financial crisis. 

- In mid-march, hackers silently entered the London-based fintech company, Finastra Group Holdings Ltd., and [captured employee passwords](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fintech-company-finastra-hit-by-ransomware/). They also installed dozens of backdoors inside Finastra's network. As a result, the company had to shut down its servers. 

Get the severity now?

So, how do banking and online financial industries safeguard identities in the consumer-centered market?

The answer lies in implementing a modern identity management system that is good at data protection.

But before exploring the growing need for identity management in the online finance sector, let's understand the security challenges in the finance sector first.

## Security Risk and Challenges Faced by Finance Industries

Financial institutions feel the most burn from cyberattacks. After all, that's where all the money is. [Attackers can take many forms](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2019/10/cybersecurity-attacks-business/) and spread across a wide range of channels. The widespread ones include:

**1\. Bot Attacks**

Bots are a series of automated online programs designed to conduct repetitive tasks. The majority of modern businesses in the financial sector use bots to enhance customer service.

But, on the downside,  if the bad guys operate them, bots can breach cybersecurity defenses and steal customer data.

For example, they can be used to launch brute force attacks and result in [corporate account takeover fraud.](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/2020/04/corporate-account-takeover-attacks/) 

You need to implement the right fraud detection solution to stop bot attacks. Also, having a robust device authentication system can keep your customers safe.

**2\. Ransomware Attacks**

It is no secret why [ransomware hackers are after financial institutions](https://www.ft.com/content/387eb604-4e72-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5). That includes banks, insurance companies, and any other organization where data is a basic entity for survival.

Cybercriminals take advantage of this vulnerability because they know companies have both the means and the incentive to pay the ransom and have their data decrypted.

The first line of defense against ransomware attacks is having a secure data backup system. Next, you need to implement disaster recovery solutions and conduct cybersecurity training for employees.

**3\. Phishing Attacks** 

In the financial service industry, phishing scams are also as common as ransomware attacks. Attackers employ social engineering tricks to break into networks.

Most of the time, they are standard email links and attachments. But phishing attacks are also executed via pop-ups, chatbots, media feeds, search engines, and browser extensions.

To counter, get your financial institute advanced endpoint protections and strengthen its payment system. Above all, prepare for how you'll limit damage and recover if you are at the receiving end.

## Advantages of Identity Management in Online Finance Sector

An identity management system can improve the security and productivity of a financial institute. It offers numerous benefits to keep customers' sensitive data safe and unharmed from attackers.

- Fulfill governance requirements by enforcing policies and auditing compliances.
- Employ security standards such as SAML, LDAP, to ensure secure access to third-party applications.
- Proactively monitor inactive user data, application utilization data, and other login activities.
