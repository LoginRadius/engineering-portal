How to set up 2FA on your accounts? And why is it important in the first place? As social media is becoming increasingly popular, security is becoming something of supreme importance. 

Even though choosing a [strong password](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2021/01/how-to-choose-a-secure-password/) helps you in certain ways, by adopting 2FA, you can improve and enhance security further. So, let's know more about this extra layer of protection and how to set up 2FA on your accounts. 

First stop. 


## What is Two-Factor Authentication

2FA is one of the best security methods that use two layers to verify a consumer's identity. This means, rather than simply entering the password to log into an account, two-factor authentication requires a code to be sent via text message to the consumer's phone number or generated through an app.

This type of verification code helps and ensures that only the authorized consumer can access their account. Similarly, [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2019/06/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) offers two or more authentication layers to approve account access for consumers. 


## What are Authenticator Apps

Authenticator apps are meant to be installed on your smartphones to obtain passcodes to sign in to your accounts. They are intended to be more secure than texting; they provide[ flexibility if you are traveling to a place where there is no mobile service](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/start-with-identity/2018/12/use-multi-factor-authentication-dont-cell-phone-access/).

Some of the options include [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en), [Microsoft Authenticator Authy](https://authy.com/guides/microsoft/), or HDE OTP. 

All these apps follow the same procedure - when you are adding a new user account, you need to scan a QR code associated with the account, and it is saved in the app. 

The next time you sign in to your app or service, it will ask for a numerical code. You need to open up the authenticator app and check the randomly generated authentication code to access your account securely.


## How to Set up 2FA on Your Social Media Accounts


![how-to-set-up-2fa-on-your-social-media-accounts](how-to-set-up-2fa-on-your-social-media-accounts.png)

A lot of applications offer 2FA currently, especially if you are storing important and sensitive data, financial information, emails, social media, files, contact details, etc. 

2FA needs more than one factor to login. This might include parameters like "something you are," for example, biometrics in the form of iris scan or fingerprints, "something you know," a password, and "something you have," like a smartphone or hardware key. 

Find out how to set up 2FA on your accounts: 


### 1. Google

If you want to set up an authenticator on the Google account, first you need to download the Google Authenticator app available on the Play Store. Once downloaded, do the following:



*   Go to Gmail and click the profile icon.
*   Choose My account and click on Sign-in & Security. 

You can add the two-**step verification** process here.
