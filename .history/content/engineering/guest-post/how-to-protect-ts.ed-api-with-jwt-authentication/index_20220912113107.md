## Introduction

Authentication is one of the most crucial aspects of any web application because it allows businesses to keep the data in their APIs safe. 
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication can be used to protect APIs from unauthorized users.

JSON Web Token, abbreviated as JWT, is an open standard that provides a concise and self-contained method for securely transferring data as a JSON object between parties. 
It stores information in a format that developers and computers can understand; the token's small size makes it easy to send via URL, POST parameter, or HTTP header. 
It enables two parties, a client and a server, to securely exchange information. 
A JWT is digitally signed using a secret or public/private key pair.

## What is Ts.ED
Ts.ED is a Node.js framework for quickly building scalable server-side applications. Ts.ED, which was created with TypeScript, allows you to create applications using object-oriented programming, functional programming, or decorators. You have the option of using the complete out-of-the-box project or customizing your own.

## Why use Ts.ED
Before we get started, consider some of the reasons why Ts.ED is a fantastic framework for web developers.

- It enables you to create REST APIs more quickly with OpenSpec and JSON Schema compliance. The rich CLI tool allows you to create a pre-configured server, saving you time, and it has a plethora of plugins from which to build your stack.
- Ts.ED is a class-based framework, controllers, pipes, and middlewares are all created as classes.
- It includes some built-in features that make testing your applications much simpler. 

## Prerequisites
This is a hands-on tutorial to follow. To get the most out of it, ensure you have these:
- A code editor of your choice
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- Basic knowledge of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomia](https://insomnia.rest/) installed

## Getting Started
To get started with Ts.ED, you need to install the CLI tool by running the command below.

```
npm install -g @tsed/cli
```

Once the installation is completed, scaffold a new Ts.ED project with the command below.

```
mkdir jwt_tsed && cd jwt_tsed && 
tsed init .
```

The `tsed init .` command will prompt you to select your project configurations. Select the following:

- Target platform: **Express**
- Architecture for the project: **Ts.ED**
- Convention file styling: choose **Ts.ED**
- The features needed for your project: **Database**
- The ORM Manager: Mongoose
- The package manager: **Yarn**

Once you've gone through the prompts, the command will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Ts.ED files and supporting modules for the project.

## Installing dependencies
With the project created, let's install the required dependencies to run the application.

```
npm install passport, passport-jwt, @types/passport-jwt @types/jsonwebtoken express-session @types/express-session mongoose @tsed/mongoose @types/passport-local
```

The above command will install the following Node.js dependencies.
- Mongoose
- Passport
- Passport-jwt
- Express Session
- Jsonwebtoken

## Generate User Schema/Model
With the dependencies installed, let's create a user schema. In Mongoose, everything begins with a Schema. Each schema corresponds to a MongoDB collection and defines the structure of the documents contained within that collection. To create a model for your TsED application, you either use the CLI tool or do it manually. For this tutorial, we'll use the CLI tool to create a model by running the command below.

```
tsed generate model User
```
The above will create a `models/UserModel.ts` file in the **src** directory. Now update the file with the code snippet below.

```
import { Property, Required } from "@tsed/schema";
import { Model, ObjectID } from "@tsed/mongoose";

@Model()
export class User {
  @ObjectID('id')
  _id: string

  @Property()
  email: string

  @Property()
  password: string

  @Property()
  @Required(false)
  token: string
}
```
In the above code snippet, we imported the required decorators to define our User model class. The `@ObjectID` decorator allows us to generate random IDs for each record in our model, the `@Property()` decorator allows us to define the properties of a model and the `@Model` decorator allows us to define a class as a Mongoose Model.

## Generate User Service
With the User model created, create a service provider for the application. To do that, generate a User service provider by running the command below.

```
tsed generate service Users
```

The above command will generate a `services/UsersService.ts` in the **src** directory. Update the file with the code snippet below.

```
import { Injectable, Inject } from "@tsed/di";
import { User } from "../models/UserModel";
import { MongooseModel } from "@tsed/mongoose";

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  @Inject(User) private model: MongooseModel<User>

  async create(body: any): Promise<User> {
    return this.model.create(body)
  }

  async findOne(query: any): Promise<any | undefined> {
    return await this.model.findOne(query);
  }

  async verifyPassword(password: string, email: string) {
    const user = await this.findOne({ email })
    return user?.password === password
  }

  attachToken(user: User, token: string) {
    user.token = token;
  }
}
```
In the above code snippet, we imported all the required decorators. We imported `Injectable()` decorator to allow us to inject the service provider into another service, and the `MongooseModel` to inject the User model into our service to have access to the methods that will allow us to perform CRUD operations on the User model.

## Generate User Controller
Next, let's a User controller to delegate tasks to our service providers by running the command below.

```
tsed generate controller Users
```
The above command will prompt you to select the route and directory for this controller. Select **/users** for the route and **rest** for the directory. Then the command will generate a `controllers/rest/UsersController.ts` file. Now update the code in the file with the code snippet below.

```
import { Controller, Get, Post, Req, Inject, BodyParams } from "@tsed/common";
import { User } from "../../models/UserModel";
import { UsersService } from "src/services/UsersService";

@Controller("/users")
export class AuthController {
  @Inject()
  usersService: UsersService;
  
 @Get()
  getUser(@Req("user") user: User): User {
    return user;
  }
  @Post("/signup")
  create(@BodyParams("email") email: string, @BodyParams("password") password: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.usersService.create({
      email, password,
    })
}
```


In the above code snippet, we imported the `UserService` provider to delicate tasks to the methods defined there, Then we used the `@Controller` decorator to declare a new controller with an API route, and we created a controller to create a new user and to get all the users in the User model. The **getUser** endpoint is accessible to everyone, which does not guarantee the integrity of the user's data. So we'll add authentication and protect this route.


## Configure Passport
Let's add authentication to the project using Passport.js. To get started, Open the `src/config/index.ts` file, import the **User** model, and configure Passport.

```
...
import {User} from "../models/UserModel";

export const config: Partial<TsED.Configuration> = {
	...
	passport: {
		disableSession: true,
		userInfoModel: User
	 },
	   // additional shared configuration   
};
...
```
By default Ts.ED uses a `UserInfo` model to serialize and deserialize users in session, so in the above snippet, we used the **User** model we created as our **UserInfo** model.

Then add the express-session middleware in the array of middlewares in the `Server.ts` file.

```
 //...
 middlewares: [
      //...
      session({
      secret: "secret",
      resave: true,
      saveUninitialized: true
    })
	//...
 ]
// ...
```

## Create JWT Protocols
A Protocol is a type of Ts.ED service that is used to declare a Passport Strategy and manage the lifecycle of a Passport. First, let's create one to declare our Passport Strategy. Create `protocol/JwtProtocol.ts` file in the **src** folder and update the file with the code snippets below.

```
import {Inject, Req} from "@tsed/common";
import {Unauthorized} from "@tsed/exceptions";
import {Arg, OnVerify, Protocol} from "@tsed/passport";
import {ExtractJwt, Strategy} from "passport-jwt";
import {UsersService} from "../services/UsersService";

@Protocol({
  name: "jwt",
  useStrategy: Strategy,
  settings: {
    jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
    secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    issuer: "localhost",
    audience: "localhost"
  }
})
export class JwtProtocol implements OnVerify {
  @Inject()
  usersService: UsersService;

  async $onVerify(@Req() req: Req, @Arg(0) jwtPayload: any) {
    const user = this.usersService.findOne({
      id: jwtPayload.sub
    });

    if (!user) {
      throw new Unauthorized("Invalid token");
    }

    req.user = user;

    return user;
  }
}
```
 
In the above code snippet, we configured a passport-jwt protocol using the `@Protocol` decorator, then we defined the settings for the protocol. In the **JwtProtocol** class we created an **onVerify** method that checks if the token in a user's request is valid and update the user data in the request payload and returns the user.

Next, create a `LocalProtocol` file in the **src/protocols** folder for the JWT local protocol to authenticate users and generate JWT Token if they are registered.

```
import { BodyParams, Constant, Inject, Req } from "@tsed/common";
import { Unauthorized } from "@tsed/exceptions";
import { OnVerify, Protocol } from "@tsed/passport";
import * as jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
import { IStrategyOptions, Strategy } from "passport-local";
import { User } from "../models/User";
import { UsersService } from "../services/UsersService";

@Protocol<IStrategyOptions>({
  name: "local",
  useStrategy: Strategy,
  settings: {
    usernameField: "email",
    passwordField: "password"
  }
})
export class LocalProtocol implements OnVerify {
  @Inject()
  usersService: UsersService;

  @Constant("passport.protocols.jwt.settings")
  jwtSettings: any;

  async $onVerify(@Req() request: Req, @BodyParams() credentials: any) {
    const { email, password } = credentials;

    const user = await this.usersService.findOne({ email });

    if (!user) {
      throw new Unauthorized("Wrong credentials");
    }

    if (! await this.usersService.verifyPassword(password, user.email)) {
      throw new Unauthorized("Wrong credentials");
    }

    const token = this.createJwtToken(user);

    user.token = token;
    return user
  }

  createJwtToken(user: User) {
    const { issuer, audience, secretOrKey, maxAge = 3600 } = this.jwtSettings;
    const now = Date.now();

    return jwt.sign(
      {
        iss: issuer,
        aud: audience,
        sub: user._id,
        exp: now + maxAge * 1000,
        iat: now
      },
      secretOrKey
    );
  }
}
```
Now create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add a JWT secret.

```
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR SECRET>
```
Next, create an index.ts file in the **src/protocols** folder and export the protocols with the code snippets.

```
export * from "./JwtProtocol";
export * from "./LocalProtocol";
```
Then import the protocol in the `Server.ts` file to make them available in the application.

```
...
import "../protocols";
...
```


## Protect the API
Now that we implement authentication in the application, let's protect our API. First, import the `@Authenticate` decorator and `@Security` to authenticate users and secure the endpoints from unauthorized users.
```
...
import { Authenticate } from "@tsed/passport";
import { Security } from "@tsed/schema";
...
```


Then we need to add a **login** to the `controllers/rest/UsersController.ts` file with the code snippet below.


```
@Controller("/auth")
export class AuthController {
  //...
  @Post("/login")
  @Authenticate("local")
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  login(@Req("user") user: User, @BodyParams() email: string, @BodyParams() password: string): User {
    user.password = ''
    return user;
  }
  //...
 }
```

Now update the **getUser** controller to make it protected with the code snippet below.

```
  @Authenticate("jwt")
  @Security("jwt")
  @Get()
  getUser(@Req("user") user: User): User {
    return user;
  }
```
Your `controllers/rest/UsersController.ts` code should look like the code snippets below.

```
import { Controller, Get, Post, Req, Inject, BodyParams } from "@tsed/common";
import { User } from "../../models/UserModel";
import { UsersService } from "src/services/UsersService";
import { Authenticate } from "@tsed/passport";
import { Security } from "@tsed/schema";

@Controller("/users")
export class AuthController {
  @Inject()
  usersService: UsersService;
  
  @Authenticate("jwt")
  @Security("jwt")
  @Get()
  getUser(@Req("user") user: User): User {
    return user;
  }
  @Post("/signup")
  create(@BodyParams("email") email: string, @BodyParams("password") password: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.usersService.create({
      email, password,
    })
  }

  @Post("/login")
  @Authenticate("local")
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  login(@Req("user") user: User, @BodyParams() email: string, @BodyParams() password: string): User {
    user.password = ''
    return user;
  }
}
```

## Testing the Application
We have successfully implemented a JWT authentication in our project and protected our API route. Now let's test things out. To get started, run the project with the command below.

```
npm run start
```

The launch Postman and create a new user by sending a **POST** request to the endpoint `localhost:8083/rest/auth/signup`. Add the payload below to the request body.

```
{
  "email":"user1@gmail.com",
  "password":"1234"
}
```

You should get the response in the screenshot below.

Next login a user by sending a **POST** request to the endpoint `localhost:8083/rest/auth/login` with the same payload.

Lastly, get the users by sending a **GET **request to the endpoint `localhost:8083/rest/auth/signup` with the token in the request headers.
